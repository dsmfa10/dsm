Deterministic State Machine:
A Concise, Post-Quantum Specification
Brandon “Cryptskii” Ramsay
December 15, 2025
The modern internet relies on centralized trust infrastructures such as certificate
authorities, OAuth servers and validator networks. These architectures impose
bottlenecks, enable censorship and remain vulnerable to quantum computing. The
DeterministicStateMachine(DSM)isacryptographicallyself-verifyingframework
that replaces consensus, accounts and third-party authorization with deterministic
hash chains and Merkle commitments. This document synthesizes the DSM
architecture and its recent extensions into a concise, implementable specification.
It formalizes bilateral state progression without clocks or heights, introduces
the Tripwire fork-exclusion theorem, incorporates the Dual-Binding Random
Walk (DBRW) anti-cloning mechanism, details an offline recovery protocol using
encrypted NFC capsules, and specifies Deterministic Join-Triggered Emissions
(DJTE): a capped, halving-scheduled distribution mechanism sourced from a
CPTA-bound Deterministic Limbo Vault (DLV) and activated only by a spend-
gate unlock. DJTE is proof-carrying and offline-verifiable: eligibility is committed
via shard activation accumulators, global population counts are committed via a
sparse Merkle root, winner selection is exact-uniform over the activated set using
deterministic index descent, and double consumption is structurally prevented by
a spent-proof SMT that transitions a Join Activation Proof (JAP) from unspent
to spent under strict-fail validation. All algorithms are post-quantum secure
and admit efficient verification on resource-constrained devices. Terminology is
aligned with current usage: we use inclusion proof (not “membership proof”), we
avoid “relationship keys,” and ordering is by hash adjacency, not time.
1 Introduction
The original vision for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system promised direct transactions
without financial intermediaries. Conventional blockchains approximate this ideal yet still
require global consensus, miners or validators, and incur probabilistic finality. DSM dis-
penses with global state entirely by localizing state to bilateral relationships and enforcing

forward-only progression through cryptographic commitments. Each participant maintains
independent hash chains for every counterparty; transactions are validated by the involved
parties alone. This architecture eliminates reorganization, censorship and liquidity constraints
while enabling true offline operation.
Deterministic emissions without consensus or time. DSM treats emissions as a deter-
ministic state transition, not a “network event.” Under DJTE, new distribution is triggered
only when a device unlocks its spend-gate and produces a Join Activation Proof (JAP). The
activated population is committed in shard-local append-only accumulators, while a global
sparse Merkle commitment binds the shard counts into a single root that defines the exact
eligible population size N. Given a public seed derived from hash-adjacent DSM state (not
time), any verifier can compute an exact-uniform winner index k∈[0,N), deterministically
map k into a shard and local position, and verify the winner by inclusion proof. Supply is
enforced by debiting a CPTA-bound source DLV with an explicit remaining balance and a
deterministic halving schedule; emissions never exceed the cap because over-issuance fails
verification.
Paradigmatic shift (beyond the account model). DSM is not a better account ledger;
it replaces the account model underlying the modern internet. In DSM, identity and own-
ership are not mutable rows curated by institutions but immutable mathematical objects
bound to users’ cryptographic state. Devices attach to a user’s genesis via the Device
Tree, and each device’s Per-Device SMT defines the user’s bilateral relationships from first
principles—eliminating custodial account recovery, authorization servers, and third-party
revocation lists. The result is a continuously evolving, self-verifying user-controlled state,
rather than institution-controlled accounts.
2 Cryptographic Foundations
2.1 Straight Hash Chains
A hash chain encodes ordering by linking each state to the hash of its predecessor. Formally,
a straight hash chain C = (S0,S1,...) satisfies
Sn+1 = Build(Sn,payloadn+1), hn := H(Sn), hn+1 := H(Sn+1), (1)
with adjacency requiring that hn is embedded in Sn+1 and verified under canonical encoding.
Every state commits to its entire history; reversing or editing requires a collision or second
preimage.
Hash function (normative). DSM splits the generic single-tag hash into two
domain-distinct primitives so that single-input and multi-input hashing cannot
be conflated at higher layers (which would otherwise admit length-extension
ambiguities — e.g., H_one("ab" || "c") vs H_one("abc") under naive
concatenation).

Single-input hash (one byte string):
H_one(X) := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/hash-data\0" ∥X .

Multi-input hash (k ≥ 1 byte strings, order-significant):
H_multi(X_1, ..., X_k) := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/hash-multiple\0" ∥X_1 ∥... ∥X_k .

The ASCII domain tag plus NUL (\0) is prepended byte-for-byte prior to hashing
in both cases. Unless a section explicitly states otherwise, "H(·)" elsewhere
in this specification refers to H_one when applied to a single argument and
H_multi when applied to multiple arguments.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 3
Canonical encoding (normative). Whenever the specification requires hashing or signing
a structured object (state, receipt commit, proofs), the object is first serialized using DSM
Envelope wire v3 deterministic Protobuf rules (Sec. 4.2.1). No JSON, CBOR, base64, hex
text encodings, or non-deterministic serializers are permitted in acceptance predicates.
To accelerate lookups, an optional sparse index over checkpoints {Sk,S2k,...}can be main-
tained; this is an implementation optimization that does not affect acceptance rules.
2.2 Merkle Trees and Sparse Merkle Trees
DSM uses two Merkle structures:
• Device Tree (standard Merkle). A standard Merkle tree whose leaves are device
identifiers DevID owned by a single genesis account G. This tree binds all devices to G.
• Per-Device SMT. For each device A, a Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT) indexes A’s bilateral
relationships. Each leaf represents one relationship (A ↔B) and stores the current
relationship commitment (e.g. the current chain tip digest hA↔B).
In both structures, internal nodes store the hash of their two children and inclusion proofs
are logarithmic in the tree depth.
Node hashing (normative). For any binary Merkle node with left child digest Land right
child digest R,
Node(L,R) := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/merkle-node\0" ∥L∥R ,
and leaves are hashed with an explicit leaf domain:
Leaf(X) := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/merkle-leaf\0" ∥X .
SMT Parameters: The zero leaf value is ZERO_LEAF (exactly 32 zero bytes). Leaf keys for
relationship indexing are derived as
kA↔B := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/smt-key\0" ∥min(DevIDA,DevIDB) ∥max(DevIDA,DevIDB),
using lexicographic ordering on the 32-byte identifiers to ensure canonicality.

Keyspace & bit order. (MSB-first).
SMT keys are 256-bit big-endian; bit i walks from MSB to LSB
Non-inclusion proof (SMT). Structure: proof encodes k, vpath, siblings[] where:
• k is the 32-byte key queried.
• vpath is either
1. the existing leaf k′,v′ at the first divergence bit from k, or
2. the explicit marker absent if the path only hits DEFAULT nodes.
• siblings[] is the ordered list of 32-byte sibling hashes from root to leaf.
VerifyNonInclusion(root,k,proof):
1. Walk siblings[] using MSB-first bit order to reconstruct the path hash upward to a
candidate root.
2. Case (a): if vpath is a concrete leaf (k′,v′), require k′̸= k and that (k′,v′) is consistent with
the proof’s divergence position; the reconstructed root must equal root.
3. Case (b): if vpath is absent, require that the leaf position for k is ZERO_LEAF under the
provided siblings and defaults; the reconstructed root must equal root.
Protobuf encoding (normative). All SMT proofs are serialized as DSM Envelope wire v3
Protobuf messages with deterministic serialization (Sec. 4.2.1). For non-inclusion proofs, the
message MUST contain:
• bytes key (size 32) for k
• oneof path_value:
1. message ExistingLeaf { bytes key_prime (size 32); bytes value_prime (size
32); }
2. bool absent = true
• repeated bytes siblings where each element is size 32, ordered from root-to-leaf.
No CBOR, JSON, base64, or hex-text encodings are permitted for proofs in acceptance
predicates.

2.3 Two-Layer Commit Path (Genesis to Device to Relationship)
Each accepted relationship state has a compact commit path:
hA↔B πrel −−−→rA and DevIDA
πdev −−−→RG, (2)
where rA is A’s Per-Device SMT root and RG is the Device Tree root for genesis G. Here
πrel and πdev are inclusion proofs. This ties every bilateral update to both the device and its
genesis without any global ledger.
2.4 Genesis, Device IDs, and Domain Separation
Each user has a genesis digest G∈{0,1}256. Each device holds a long-term post-quantum
attestation keypair (skA,pkA) (SPHINCS+), a stable device identifier DevIDA (a domain-
separated digest bound to pkA and device attestation), and a Per-Device SMT over relation-
ships. All hashes and signatures are domain-separated (e.g. labels like "DSM/receipt\0").
Domain tags are part of the commitment and are not optional.
Device identifier (normative). specific, but deterministic). Then
Let AttA be the stable device attestation digest (platform-
DevIDA := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/devid\0" ∥pkA ∥AttA.
2.5 Genesis State Creation
Let b1,...,bt be independent entropy contributions and A contextual binding parameters.
Define
G= BLAKE3-256 "DSM/genesis\0" ∥b1∥···∥bt∥A . (3)
3 Two Merkle Structures: Storage and Replication
Device Tree (standard Merkle). The Device Tree (leaves = device IDs) is fully replicated
across storage nodes and across all devices under G. Adding a device is an online event: a
new leaf is inserted and the updated root RG is propagated to all devices.
Per-Device SMT. Each device A maintains its own Per-Device SMT root rA. These per-
device SMTs are not mirrored across the user’s other devices. Storage nodes keep aggregated
mirrors (e.g., latest rA and compact indices) for availability and recovery; storage nodes are
dumb by design and do not validate transitions.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 6
4 State Transition Protocol (Clockless Ordering)
Fix parties (A,B) with local parent tip hn for the relationship CA↔B at device A.
4.1 Pre-commitment and Attestation
Initiator prepares a precommit with fresh entropy e:
Cpre = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/precommit\0" ∥hn∥payload∥e . (4)
Counterparty verifies and co-signs Cpre. The successor Sn+1 embeds hn; hn+1 = H(Sn+1).

4.1.1 Fork-Aware Pre-Commit Family (Deterministic Smart Commitments)
The single-tag form (4) covers the classical "one candidate per parent" case.
DSM additionally supports deterministic smart commitments built from
pre-commit forking — authoring multiple mutually-exclusive candidate
successors at the same parent and ratifying exactly one. Tripwire (Sec. 6)
guarantees only one candidate can be stitched. To bind the candidate set
itself, fork-aware pre-commits use a five-tag domain family, all under the
versioned namespace "DSM/precommit/.../v2":

Pre-commit root (commits to the full candidate set):
  C_pre^root := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/precommit/root/v2\0" ∥h_n ∥enc(candidates).

Per-candidate commitment hash (one per branch):
  C_pre^i   := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/precommit/commitment-hash/v2\0" ∥h_n ∥payload_i ∥e_i.

Fork context (binds the parent and branch indexing):
  ctx_fork  := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/precommit/fork-context/v2\0" ∥h_n ∥C_pre^root.

Fork positions (ordered list of candidate slots):
  pos_fork  := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/precommit/fork-positions/v2\0" ∥enc(positions).

Invalidation proof (proves which other branches were not stitched):
  π_inv     := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/precommit/invalidation-proof/v2\0" ∥enc(invalidated).

The classical single-candidate form (4) is the degenerate case where
candidates = {payload, e} with one element. Acceptance predicates extend
identically: Tripwire forbids two adjacent successors at the same parent
regardless of how many candidates the root committed to. The five-tag
family is intentionally distinct from the bare "DSM/precommit\0" so that
fork-aware and non-fork-aware pre-commits cannot collide under any
canonical-encoding ambiguity.

The fork-aware family is a deliberate extension beyond the classical
(non-Turing) bounded-control-flow model: it lets developers express
deterministic state machines (deferred payments, contingent releases,
conditional ratifications) without introducing a contract VM. By design,
control flow remains bounded — every branch is committed up front, and
none of the unbounded-loop / reentrancy / gas-griefing surfaces of
Turing-complete VMs are admitted (cross-reference Sec. 7.2).

4.2 Receipt Construction (Per-Device SMT Replace)
Aupdates its Per-Device SMT by replacing the leaf for (A↔B) from hn to hn+1, producing
r′
A. The stitched receipt encodes
τA→B = enc "DSM/stitched-receipt/v3\0", G, DevIDA, DevIDB,
hn, hn+1, rA, r′
A,
πrel hn∈rA , π
′
rel hn+1 ∈r′
A , πdev DevIDA∈RG ,
and is signed by both parties (Sec. 11.1). Note: the Device Tree RG does not change for
relationship updates; it is referenced only for device→genesis binding.
4.2.1 Canonical Commit Form (Frozen)
The canonical commit form defines the byte-exact serialization used for hashing and signing
operations, separate from Protobuf transport envelopes. All cryptographic commitments
(receipt signatures, precommitments, and inclusion proofs) use this deterministic encoding.
Protobuf-Deterministic Definition (normative) The canonical commit form is the deter-
ministic Protobuf serialization (DSM Envelope wire v3) of the ReceiptCommit message only.
Transport envelopes MAY wrap this message for routing, fragmentation, or b0x delivery, but
envelopes are excluded from all cryptographic commitments.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 7
ReceiptCommit fields (normative) receipt-commit serializes the following fields in fixed
semantic order (the Protobuf tags are defined in the DSM schema v2.4.0 / Envelope wire
v3):
ReceiptCommit {
genesis: bytes (size 32) devid_a: bytes (size 32) devid_b: bytes (size 32) parent_tip: bytes (size 32) child_tip: bytes (size 32) parent_root: bytes (size 32) child_root: bytes (size 32) rel_proof_parent: bytes rel_proof_child: bytes dev_proof: bytes ; G
; DevID_A
; DevID_B
; h_n
; h_{n+1}
; r_A
; r_A’
; pi_rel(h_n in r_A)
; pi’_rel(h_{n+1} in r_A’)
; pi_dev(DevID_A in R_G)
}
Deterministicserializationrules(normative) AllimplementationsMUSTproduceidentical
bytes for the same logical ReceiptCommit:
1. Protobuf encoding is DSM Envelope wire v3, deterministic: fields are serialized in strictly
increasing tag order; unknown fields are forbidden.
2. All bytes fields use definite length (length-delimited) encoding.
3. The first seven bytes fields are exactly 32 bytes; any other length is invalid.
4. Prooffieldsarerawproofbytesoftheirrespectiveproofmessages(alsoProtobuf-deterministic).
Nested proof messages MUST themselves be deterministically serialized with no unknown
fields.
5. map fields are forbidden in canonical commit forms. repeated fields (if any appear inside
proof messages) are order-significant and MUST be serialized in the given order.
6. No optional fields, extensions, or forward-compatible padding are permitted in canonical
commit forms. Versioning occurs at the envelope/message-type level, not via extra fields.
Hashing (normative)
commit := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/receipt-commit\0" ∥canonical_protobuf_bytes.
TheASCIIdomaintagplusNUL(\0)isprependedbyte-for-bytetocanonical_protobuf_bytes
prior to hashing.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 8
Test vectors (normative) Canonical test vectors are distributed as Protobuf fixtures (byte-
exact files) alongside expected BLAKE3-256 digests. Implementations MUST reproduce the
digests exactly for conformance. Test vectors are intentionally not embedded as hex strings
to avoid non-Protobuf representations in normative acceptance paths.
4.3 Verification Rules
To accept a claimed update (hn →hn+1) rooted at (rA →r′
A) under G, a verifier checks:
1. Both signatures verify under the presented SPHINCS+ public keys (Sec. 11.1).
2. πrel proves hn ∈rA and π′
rel proves hn+1 ∈r′
A (Per-Device SMT inclusion).
3. πdev proves DevIDA is included in RG (Device Tree inclusion).
4. Recomputing the Per-Device SMT leaf replace yields r′
A byte-exactly.
5. The parent tip hn has not been previously consumed for this relationship.
There are no timestamps, heights, or counters in acceptance predicates.
The acceptance predicate is fully algorithmic:
addrA→B := b0x[BLAKE3-256 "DSM/addr-G\0" ∥G∥saltG 0..31 ; BLAKE3-256 "DSM/addr-D\0" ∥DevI
4.4 Deterministic Transition Guarantees (Adjacency Only)
Let V(Sn,Sn+1) be the predicate that the receipt for Sn+1 is valid given Sn. Then:
V(Sn,Sn+1) ⇒EmbedParent(Sn+1) = hn, (5)
V(Sn,Sn+1) ∧V(Sn,S′
n+1) ⇒Sn+1 = S′
n+1, (6)
V(Sn,Sn+1) ⇒PerDeviceReplace(rA,hn →hn+1) = r′
A, (7)
¬∃S′
n+1 ̸= Sn+1 : V(Sn,S′
n+1) and Accept(S′
n+1) = 1. (8)
For token balances (Sec. 8), admissible successors preserve supply locally and globally.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 9
5 Online and Offline Transport
5.1 Online Unilateral Transport: b0x[...]
Online sends are delivered unilaterally to a deterministic prefix. The address is an opaque
deterministic routing token derived from genesis, recipient device, and the sender’s current
parent tip for the relationship:
b0x[BLAKE3-256("DSM/addr-G\0" ∥G∥saltG) BLAKE3-256("DSM/addr-D\0" ∥DevIDB ∥saltD) BL
(9)
where Gis the recipient’s genesis, DevIDB the recipient device, hn the sender’s current parent
tip for (A↔B), nonce an ephemeral per-send value, and saltG, saltD are per-user blinding
salts. All three components are blinded to prevent correlation attacks while maintaining
deterministic addressing. The address is treated as raw bytes in DSM Envelope wire v3 (no
hex/base64/JSON encodings in acceptance predicates). The recipient applies the candidate
iff it is adjacent to its local parent and the included proofs in Sec. 4.2 verify. Otherwise it is
queued (waiting for predecessors) or rejected.
5.2 Online “b0x check” semantics (no global sync)
DSM does not “sync” global state. When online, devices check their b0x for waiting items.
Acceptance remains strictly local: a received item is either (i) accepted because it is adjacent
and proofs verify, (ii) queued because it is not yet adjacent, or (iii) rejected as invalid. Storage
nodes are dumb by design and may deliver arbitrary bytes; devices are the sole validators.
5.3 Offline Bilateral
Offline requiresboth parties live (e.g. Bluetooth/NFC). The parties exchange precommitments,
finalize, and countersign the receipt locally (no b0x). Offline finality does not require going
online; the resulting receipt may later be placed into the recipient’s b0x (or exchanged
out-of-band) as a normal deliverable object.
5.4 Modal Synchronization Lock
Let PendingA↔B hold if an accepted but not-yet-adjacent online projection exists for (A,B)
in either party’s b0x or local queue.
Theorem 1 (Pending-Online Lock). If PendingA↔B holds, initiating an offline transaction
for (A,B) is invalid until the pending items are resolved (accepted or rejected). Relationships
(A,C) for C ̸= B proceed unaffected.

online projection exists risks parent divergence; adjacency uniqueness would be violated.
Disjoint relationships commute.
6 Tripwire Theorem and Causal Consistency
6.1 Atomic Interlock Tripwire
The Tripwire theorem formalizes fork exclusion in stitched DSM updates.
Theorem 2 (Atomic Interlock Tripwire). Assume SPHINCS+ is EUF-CMA and H is
collision resistant. The probability that an adversary generates two distinct receipts that both
consume the same parent tip and both verify is negligible.
Sketch. Two accepted successors to the same parent require either a signature forgery or a
collision in the chained hash or Merkle commit path.
Intuition: Tripwire as a Ledger Replacement. Each device A maintains a Per-Device
SMT with root rA that commits to all bilateral relationships (A↔B) as leaves, with each
leaf storing the current relationship tip hA↔B. Whenever (A,B) updates their chain, both
parties update their local SMT roots, and stitched receipts prove inclusion of the old and
new tips under rA (and, symmetrically, under rB if desired), plus inclusion of DevIDA in the
Device Tree root RG.
Suppose an adversary attempts to double-spend on (A,B) by producing two conflicting
successors that both claim to consume the same parent hn. Any honest device that later
interacts with A (or B) demands inclusion proofs under the presenting device’s current rA
(or rB). Maintaining both forks would require either:
• two incompatible leaves for the same relationship under a single SMT root, or
• two incompatible SMT roots for the same device key that both verify against the same
stitched history.
Either case forces a collision in the hash chain or Merkle path. Thus, even devices that
never transacted directly (e.g. Alice with Charlie) are wired into a shared global invariant via
shared counterparties: per-device SMT roots and stitched receipts form a web of “tripwires”
that collectively forbid double-spend, without a global public ledger.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 11
6.2 Causal Consistency
Stitched receipts induce a DAG of Per-Device SMT roots across devices. A root rD is
accepted iff for every referenced relationship tip along the path into rD, there exists a valid
inclusion proof demonstrating its presence in the corresponding Per-Device SMT and a
Device Tree inclusion for the signing device. This enforces causal consistency without a global
sequence.
6.3 First-Contact Binding
When an isolated device presents its first countersigned receipt, it irrevocably binds to that
branch: future states must extend it, or verification fails unless H or SPHINCS+ is broken.
7 Architectural Rationale and Differentiators
This section concisely integrates key architectural context from the long-form paper into the
implementable specification. It explains why DSM adopts these design choices and highlights
the practical consequences for deployment and operations.
7.1 Subscription-Based Economic Model (Gasless Operation)
DSM replaces per-transaction gas with a subscription-based model that aligns cost with
persistent resource use rather than event frequency.
• Storage-proportional fees. Users fund storage and availability via periodic subscriptions
that scale with retained state (device tree entries, per-device SMT heads, and retained
proofs), not with the number of state transitions.
• One-time creation fees. Token policy anchors (CPTA) and minted-asset creation incur
a one-time fee that covers indexing, replication commitments, and archival integrity.
• Operator sustainability. Storage nodes are paid for capacity, durability, and retrieval
bandwidth rather than transient compute. This removes incentives to throttle usage via
gas and aligns incentives with availability.
Result: users experience gas-free transactions; developer UX is predictable; and economics
track the real cost drivers (storage and bandwidth), not click-volume.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 12
7.2 Deterministic Smart Commitments vs. Turing-Complete Contracts
DSM intentionally does not expose a Turing-complete contract VM. Instead it uses determinis-
tic smart commitments—bounded, verifiable state machines assembled from pre-commitments
and stitched receipts.
• Security by construction. By excluding unbounded control flow, DSM removes entire
bug classes (reentrancy cascades, halting/DoS via infinite loops, gas griefing) and enables
straightforward formal auditing of admissible transitions.
• Expressiveness via pre-commitment forking. Complex, multi-path workflows are
expressed by preparing multiple pre-commit digests (branch candidates) and later ratifying
exactly one adjacent successor. Tripwire (fork exclusion) ensures only a single branch can
be accepted for a given parent.
• Determinism. Acceptance predicates depend solely on hash adjacency, inclusion proofs,
and signatures (no clocks, no global height). This keeps validation portable and offline-
capable.
7.3 Deterministic Limbo Vault (DLV): Purpose and Lifecycle
The DLV is a cryptographic construction for trustless asset management under self-executing
conditions—without external oracles or a contract VM. It complements the invariants stated
earlier with a clear operational lifecycle:
1. Create and encumber. A vault configuration (L,C,H) is committed, and assets are
placed under the vault’s control with a public commitment to the lock L and condition set
C.
2. Accrue proofs. Parties produce stitched receipts that, when combined, cryptographically
attest the satisfaction of C.
3. Derive unlock key. The unlocking secret becomes computable only upon fulfillment of
C via a stitched proof-of-completion σ:
skV = H "DSM/dlv-unlock\0" ∥L∥C∥σ .
Prior to σ, skV is infeasible to derive.
Result: autonomous escrow, deferred payments, and contingent releases operate fully offline
and remain verifiable under DSM’s receipt algebra.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 13
7.4 Security: Bilateral Control Attack Vector
DSM explicitly analyzes the edge case where a single adversary momentarily controls both
parties to a relationship (“bilateral control”). Even in this strongest per-relationship threat
model:
• The adversary can produce valid signatures on conflicting candidates, but cannot make
both successors acceptable because Tripwire forbids consuming the same parent twice.
• Crucially, the mathematical invariants (e.g., conservation of balances, uniqueness of parent
consumption) remain inviolable: any transition violating these constraints is rejected as
invalid.
Implication: bilateral control does not enable double-spend; it only permits the adversary
to choose which valid successor gets finalized, never to realize an arithmetically impossible
state.
8 Token Management and Balance Invariants
Let Bn be the token balance at Sn. Valid updates satisfy
Bn+1 = Bn + ∆n+1, Bn+1 ≥0. (10)
For a transfer α, sender and recipient use ∆sender =−α and ∆recipient = +α. Summing ∆
across all parties is zero, preserving total supply without global synchronization. Each state
binds (e′
n+1,encapsulatedn+1,Bn+1,H(Sn),opn+1) under canonical encoding.

Balance Implementation (normative). The Balance struct maintains a single value field
representing the total token amount. The available() method MUST return the full value
without subtraction of any "locked" amounts, as all token operations are atomic and coupled
to state transitions. Historical bug: Balance.available() previously used saturating_sub
to subtract locked amounts, causing balances to display as half their actual value after
online transfers. This was fixed in the February 2026 audit.

Atomicity (normative). Any token-affecting operation MUST be represented as a DSM
state transition and MUST be coupled to the same adjacency and receipt predicates as any
other state update. Token deltas cannot be applied “out of band”; a balance change without
a valid adjacent receipt is invalid.
Theorem 3 (Double-Spending Impossibility). There do not exist two distinct accepted
successors of Sn that allocate the same spendable balance to different recipients.
Sketch. Conflicting successors would both consume the same parent but assign identical
spend power to different recipients; acceptance of both contradicts Tripwire or hash collision
resistance.
Theorem 4 (Global Supply Conservation). For any set of bilateral transactions across the
entire network, the sum of all ∆ values across all parties is zero, preserving total token supply
without requiring global synchronization or consensus.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 14
Proof. Consider a bilateral transaction between parties Aand B with transfer amount α. By
construction, ∆A =−α and ∆B = +α, so ∆A + ∆B = 0.
For any set of transactions forming a connected graph of bilateral relationships, each transac-
tion contributes zero net supply change when summed across its participants. Since each
token movement affects exactly two parties with equal and opposite ∆ values, the global sum
all parties ∆ = 0.
This conservation holds without global synchronization because each bilateral relationship
maintains its own invariant locally, and the global property emerges from the bilateral
structure itself.
Capped emissions (normative). Global conservation applies to transfers. Emissions are
modeled as deterministic reveals from a CPTA-bound source DLV (Sec. 9) and are therefore
conservation-preserving with respect to the fixed total supply: an emission allocates +α to
the recipient while debiting−αfrom the source DLV balance in the same adjacent transition.
Any transition that would cause the source DLV to underflow is invalid.
8.1 Deterministic Limbo Vault Invariants
Let a vault be V = (L,C,H). The unlocking secret emerges only upon stitched proof-of-
completion σ:
skV = H(L∥C∥σ). (11)
Without σ, recovering skV is negligible in λ.
DLV domain separation (normative).
skV = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/dlv-unlock\0" ∥L∥C∥σ .
This construction is deterministic, clockless, and purely receipt-derived.
9 Context Policy & Token Anchors (CPTA)
This section specifies a deterministic, immutable policy object used to define token behavior
and to constrain subsequent token operations under DSM. A CPTA is a single canonical
Protobuf object with a BLAKE3 commitment; clients cache the object locally and may
fetch its full bytes from any storage node by commitment digest. Enforcement is entirely
device-local via inclusion proofs and receipt predicates; no external executor is trusted.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 15
Goals. (1) Deterministic structure for the parts DSM must verify directly (ticker, alias,
decimals, caps, transferability constraints, emission source binding). (2) An expressive hook
for external commitments (eligibility sets, deposit ledgers, registries), referenced by hash and
proven via receipts, without importing any foreign runtime.
9.1 Identity, Immutability, and Anchoring
Token genesis GT. Each token has a token genesis GT ∈{0,1}256, derived by the issuer in
a collision-resistant way, e.g.
GT = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/token-genesis\0" ∥Gissuer ∥sT ,
where Gissuer is the issuer’s genesis and sT is issuer-chosen entropy.
CPTA commitment. The canonical policy bytes (Sec. 9.3) hash to
policy_
commit := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/cpta\0" ∥canonical_cpta_bytes.
CPTAs are immutable. Any change yields a new policy_
commit and a new GT (new token).
UI may display the first 8 or 16 bytes of policy_
commit for legibility, but protocol logic
always uses the full 32-byte digest.
Anchoringandcaching. ReceiptsthatcreateorreferenceatokenMUSTincludepolicy_
commit
and MAY include an opaque policy anchor pointer (e.g., content-addressed hash or retrieval
hint). Devices fetch bytes by digest from any storage node and cache locally; the digest binds
the content (no trust in the server).
9.2 Object Model (Structured Core + External Commitments)
A CPTA splits into a structured core(deterministically enforced by DSM) and an external
section (pure commitments—hashes the policy refers to but never executes).
Structured core (normative fields).
• identity: GT (32B), version (u32).
• display: alias (UTF-8), ticker (A-Z, 2-8 chars), decimals (u8; 0 for NFTs/SBTs).
• kind: FUNGIBLE |NFT |SBT (non-transferable).
• supply: cap (u128, fixed); initial_alloc (u128, optional, debited from source DLV if
nonzero).
• emission: DJTE parameters, binding deterministic join-triggered reveals to this token:
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 16
- source_dlv: 32B vault identifier (CPTA-bound DLV holding the pre-existing supply).
- halving_interval: u64 (number of emissions per halving epoch).
- base_amount: u128 (epoch-0 emission amount before halving).
- recipient_mode: WINNER_UNIFORM (deterministic exact-uniform selection over activated
set; Sec. ??).
• authority (discretionary operations): threshold t-of-N over a sorted list of issuer
genesis IDs. Discretionary mint/burn is OPTIONAL and, if enabled, MUST still respect
cap. DJTE emissions never require human signatures.
• allowlists (optional):
a) inline_allowlist: sorted list of recipient genesis IDs (for small sets), or
b) allowlist_root: 32B Merkle root for large sets; claims present a Merkle inclusion
proof.
NFT/SBT claims MUST be one-per-genesis unless policy states otherwise.
External section (commitments only).
• eligibility_anchors[]: hashes of external datasets that define eligibility (e.g., a deposit
ledger digest, a registrar’s roster).
• metadata_anchors[]: hashes of off-path documents (legal terms, branding), informational
only.
DSM never executes external data. Receipts reference an anchor by hash and supply whatever
proof is required by the policy (e.g., a Merkle proof against an anchored root). Verifiers only
check digest equality and proof soundness.
9.3 Canonical Commit Form (CPTA)
Protobuf (deterministic, normative). The canonical CPTA bytes are the deterministic
Protobuf serialization (DSM Envelope wire v3) of the CptaPolicy message as defined in the
DSM schema. No CBOR, JSON, base64, or hex-text encodings are permitted in normative
commit paths. The CPTA commitment is the BLAKE3-256 of the domain-separated prefix
plus the encoded bytes:
policy_
commit := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/cpta\0" ∥canonical_cpta_bytes.
Deterministic Protobuf rules match Sec. 4.2.1: increasing tag order, no unknown fields, no
maps in canonical objects, and order-significant repeated fields.

9.5 Acceptance Predicates (Creation and Ops)
Token creation (normative). A TokenCreate succeeds iff:
1. policy.policy_commit equals the BLAKE3 of the canonical CPTA Protobuf bytes;
2. policy.token_genesis= GT and is unique under issuer-defined namespace;
3. ticker and alias satisfy format constraints; decimals matches kind;
4. the cap is finite and nonzero; the source_dlv is present for DJTE-enabled tokens;
5. any initial_alloc is applied atomically under the same receipt and (if >0) is debited
from source_dlv.
Transfers. reject any transfer (non-transferable).
As in Sec. 8: ∆sender =−α, ∆recipient = +α, non-negativity preserved; SBT MUST
Mint/Burn (optional). If enable_discretionary_mint_burn=false, any Mint/Burn op-
eration is invalid. Otherwise, require authority.threshold distinct cosignatures from
authority.signers. Enforce cap and balance non-negativity. Discretionary mint/burn
MUST NOT be used to bypass DJTE or exceed the fixed cap.
Emissions (DJTE). DJTE emissions are deterministic reveals from the CPTA-bound
source_dlv, triggered only by spend-gate unlock events (JAPs). A DjteEmission is valid
iff:
1. jap_hash is valid and unspent under the global SpentProofSMT transition for this emission
index (Sec. ??);
2. selection_proof proves the exact eligible population size N (ShardCountSMT root) and
inclusion of the selected winner in the shard activation accumulator (SAA);
3. the winner derivation is reproduced deterministically from the public seed and maps to
recipient_genesis by exact-uniform index descent;
4. amount_u128 equals the policy’s halving schedule at emission_index and does not exceed
remaining balance in the source_dlv (no underflow);
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 20
5. the state transition debits source_dlv by−α and credits the recipient by +α atomically
in the same adjacent receipt.
No human signatures are required for DJTE emission validity.
NFT/SBT claims and allowlists. If allowlist.kind= INLINE, check the claimant’s
genesis is in the inline list (binary search over the sorted set). If MERKLE_ROOT, verify the
Merkle inclusion proof against the anchored root; enforce one-per-genesis (device-local counter
over stitched receipts). If eligibility_anchors[] are present, the receipt MUST carry
evidence that reduces to an equality/containment proof against at least one anchored digest
(e.g., a Merkle proof against a deposit-ledger root). Evidence is a Protobuf bundle; DSM
does not execute external code.
Binding to policy. All TokenOps MUST include policy_
commit; verifiers reject if it differs
from the token’s creation policy_
commit.
9.6 Worked Examples (Normative Patterns)
9.6.1 A. University Degree (Non-Web3 Credential, SBT)
Intent. Issue a non-transferable credential NFT (SBT) to each graduate.
CPTA (core).
• kind=SBT, decimals=0, cap=2128
−1 (effectively unbounded within u128), DJTE disabled,
and discretionary mint/burn enabled with authority=t=2 of N=3 (Registrar, Provost,
Records Office).
• allowlist.kind=MERKLE_ROOT where the root commits the graduating cohort’s genesis
IDs (sorted).
• eligibility_anchors[] includes the digest of the university’s final award roster commit-
ment.
Issuance. Each student submits NftClaim with (i) a Merkle proof against the cohort root,
and optionally (ii) eligibility evidence proving inclusion in the award-roster anchor. The
receipt is stitched bilaterally (student↔university device), and the SBT is created via a
deterministic branch that requires the authority threshold.
Transfer. Rejected (non-transferable). Revocation can be modeled as a mutually exclusive
burn branch requiring authority t-of-N.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 21
9.6.2 B. Community Credit (Fungible, DJTE Emission)
Intent. Local currency whose distribution is deterministic, capped, and triggered by new
spend-gated genesis activations.
CPTA (core).
• kind=FUNGIBLE, decimals=2, cap=109 units, initial_alloc=0.
• DJTE enabled with source_dlv bound to the token’s pre-existing supply, base_amount
and halving_interval defining a Bitcoin-style halving schedule.
• authority.threshold=0 and discretionary mint/burn disabled.
• no allowlist (any genesis can hold/transfer).
Emission. Each spend-gate unlock produces a JAP, which deterministically triggers a DJTE
emission. The emission selects a recipient by exact-uniform winner selection over the activated
population (ShardCountSMT + SAA proofs), debits the source DLV, and credits the winner
in an adjacent receipt. No signatures are required for the emission itself; only the usual
receipt signatures apply to the transition.
9.7 Interplay with External Commitments (Illustrative)
Deposit-gated NFT allowlist. If a project requires “pre-deposit →allowlist”, publish an
anchor digest of the deposit ledger (e.g., a Merkle root over tuples (genesis,amount)). Claims
includeaMerkleproofandapredicate(“amount≥threshold”)encodedinaProtobufevidence
bundle. Verifiers check: (1) anchor hash matches the CPTA’s eligibility_anchors[]; (2)
the proof reduces to the ledger root; (3) predicate holds. No server is trusted; only digests
and proofs.
9.8 Storage, Lookup, and Replication
Storage nodes index CPTAs by policy_
commit and (optionally) by ticker and alias (non-
authoritative). Devices cache CPTAs locally; any node can serve bytes (clients verify by
digest). For pointer-style retrieval, policy_pointer is a hint only—the digest is the source
of truth.
Short identifiers. UI and tables may display a short policy number (first 8-16 bytes of
policy_
commit) and ticker/alias for human legibility; protocol logic always uses full 32B
digests.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 22
9.9 Security and Determinism
• Immutability: the CPTA is frozen by policy_
commit. Any change defines a new token
(new GT).
• No clocks: operations are adjacency-verified; DJTE emissions are driven by spend-gate
unlock events and deterministic emission indices.
• Least authority: routine transfers need no signers; only optional discretionary mint/burn
require threshold signatures; DJTE emissions require none.
• Local enforceability: all predicates (allowlists, caps, authority thresholds, DJTE proofs)
are checked in the stitched receipt verification path; failure causes rejection without network
calls.
10 Storage Node Regulation and Incentives
The decentralized storage layer is governed by cryptography and economics, not discretion.
Storage nodes (a) serve object availability (Device Tree, Per-Device SMT aggregates, and
b0x messages), (b) serve Merkle/SMT proof material derived from stored byte-indexes on
demand, and (c) submit to objective audits. Sustainability follows from the subscription
model (Sec. 7.1); incentive alignment follows from hardware-bound identity and staking.
Nodes are dumb by design and signature-free; all enforcement is derived from mirrored
Protobuf bytes, deterministic hashes, and device-signed stitched receipts.
10.1 Hardware-Bound Cryptographic Identity
Each node derives a non-forgeable identity from a network genesis anchor and DBRW
binding:
nodeID = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/node-id\0" ∥Gnet ∥K(node)
DBRW ,
where Gnet is the network genesis commitment and K(node)
DBRW is the dual-binding materialized
from the node’s hardware entropy and execution environment. This makes Sybil creation
economicallycostly: duplicatingdistinct nodeIDsrequiresdistincthardwareandenvironments.
Privacy: K(node)
DBRW MUST NEVER be serialized, logged, or included in any commitment or
envelope; it is used only as internal key material.
10.2 Admission, Staking, and Service Commitments
To participate, a node presents:
1. an inclusion proof in the Node Registry SMT root Rnodes,
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 23
2. a non-inclusion (zero-leaf) proof in the Node Denylist SMT root Rdeny, and
3. a stake commitment Sin the native DSM token, bound to nodeID (implemented as a stake
DLV reference plus its stitched proof-of-funding).
All three are verifiable from canonical digests that advance via stitched receipts. Service
obligations are objective:
• Availability: serve Device Tree snapshots and Per-Device SMT aggregate heads with
valid inclusion proofs for requested keys.
• Delivery: accept and relay b0x-prefixed message blobs and make them retrievable until
consumed.
• Auditability: provestorageofrandomlysampleditemsviainclusionproofsandcycle-index
continuity checks tied to the current registry roots.
10.3 Normative Audit Procedures and Evidence Handling
Storage audits in DSM are entirely protocol-native and byte-driven. Storage nodes remain
dumb and signature-free; all enforcement flows from mirrored Protobuf bytes, deterministic
hashes, and device-signed receipts.
We fix the following normative audit structure:
1. Replica placement and PaidK gate. For any object address addr, a deterministic
placement function maps
addr −→ Replicas(addr) ⊆{nodeID}
using a Fisher-Yates permutation seeded from
BLAKE3-256 "DSM/place\0" ∥addr
and the current Node Registry vector. Reads are subject to a PaidK gate: a client accepts
the content at addr only if at least K distinct nodes in Replicas(addr) return identical bytes
that (i) re-derive addr under the object-domain hash and (ii) satisfy any associated proof
predicates (SMT/Merkle) for the requested key. Any disagreement between replicas for
the same addr is objective evidence of misbehavior.
2. Node Storage SMT and ByteCommit mirroring. Each operator maintains a
Node Storage sparse Merkle tree (SMT) over the addresses it serves. After applying all
PUT/DELETEs for cycle index t, it computes
Rnode
t = SMT(NodeStoraget), bytes_
usedt =
len(ℓ).
ℓ∈leavest
It then emits a ByteCommitV3 message
Bt = node_id, t, Rnode
t , bytes_
usedt, parent_digest,
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 24
encoded via deterministic Protobuf under domain tag "DSM/bytecommit\0". Define
ht := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/bytecommit\0" ∥ProtoDet(Bt),
and address the mirrored bytes as
addrB(t) = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/obj-bytecommit\0" ∥node_id ∥u64le(t) ∥ht.
A verifier accepts Bt if and only if:
• ProtoDet(Bt) is deterministic and domain-separated;
• the digest ht matches the mirrored addressing rule above;
• the parent link is valid (ht−1 for t>0 or 032 for t= 0);
• Rnode
t validates as the Node Storage SMT root; and
• at least q identical copies of Bt are fetched from the replica set determined by the active
registry.
No storage-node signatures are ever consulted; all checks are hash- and SMT-based and
reconstructable from mirrored bytes.
3. Capacity signals and registry movement. Over cycles, the public series
ut = bytes_
usedt/C
(for fixed partition capacity C) is reconstructable from mirrored {Bt}. Nodes may publish
Up/Down capacity signals that reference a window of committed ByteCommits by digest.
A signal is accepted if and only if all referenced Bj are valid and the corresponding uj
lie above (Up) or below (Down) configured thresholds. Node position changes in the
registry—how many entries to add or remove—are a pure function of these accepted signals
and the discovery window; there is no voting, scheduling, or discretionary governance.
4. Evidence records and Node Denylist SMT. When a client or auditor detects misbe-
havior, it constructs a minimal evidence record E summarizing:
• the offending nodeID and cycle indices;
• the conflicting storage bytes or ByteCommit bodies; and
• the expected values implied by DSM rules (placement, PaidK, addressing, and SMT
structure).
The record is summarized by a domain-separated digest
hE = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/evidence\0" ∥ProtoDet(E),
which is inserted as a leaf in the Node Denylist SMT with a pointer to the associated stake
DLV. Any third party with access to the same bytes can recompute hE and verify that the
node violated deterministic predicates; no storage-node signatures are required.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 25
5. DrainProof and exit. A node that wishes to exit publishes ByteCommits whose Node
Storage SMT reflects an empty (or near-empty) partition for a configured number of
consecutive cycle indices. This sequence of (Bt,Rnode
t ) pairs constitutes a DrainProof.
Stake unlock is then a deterministic predicate over this proof and the Node Registry state,
not a governance decision.
All audit evidence is reconstructable from mirrored Protobuf bytes and hashes. Storage nodes
remain dumb and signature-free; only end devices ever sign stitched receipts.
10.4 Dominant-Strategy Compliance
Let pd be the probability that a deviation is detected over a discovery window W (measured
in cycle indices), given that clients and auditors verify:
• the mirrored ByteCommitV3 chain for each node,
• replica consistency under the PaidK gate for sampled addresses, and
• the validity of any capacity signals that affect registry position.
Because all of these objects are mirrored deterministically, any sustained deviation (dropping
objects, serving inconsistent bytes, lying about capacity) eventually appears as one of:
1. an invalid or missing ByteCommit for some cycle index,
2. a PaidK violation (replicas disagreeing on bytes for the same address),
3. an invalid capacity signal whose referenced ByteCommits fail checks.
Let F denote the economic penalty of being placed in the Node Denylist (slashed stake plus
foregone future subscription revenue), and let G bound the short-term gain from deviating
(e.g., skipping replicas or overstating capacity). DSM chooses parameters
(N,K,C,pricing,stake size,W)
such that
pd·F > G.
Then the expected payoff of deviation is strictly negative:
E[deviate] = (1−pd) G−pdF < 0.
Compliance is thus a dominant strategy. This conclusion does not rely on committees,
timestamps, or discretionary governance. All inputs to pd, F, and G are deterministically
derivable from:
• mirrored Node Storage SMT roots and ByteCommitV3 messages,
• the active Node Registry and Node Denylist SMT roots, and
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 26
• stake and subscription pricing recorded in DLVs.
Any verifier with access to the same bytes reaches the same slashing and admission decisions.
11 Post-Quantum Key Evolution and Transport
DSMusesaKyberKEMtoderiveper-transitionstepmaterialandSPHINCS+toauthenticate
receipts. All derivations are clockless and deterministically bound to adjacency inputs.
Deterministic Kyber encapsulation (normative). from public and local secret inputs:
Let coins be deterministically derived
coins := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/kyber-coins\0" ∥hn ∥Cpre ∥DevIDsender ∥KDBRW.
Encapsulation uses a deterministic coins interface (equivalently, a seeded KEM):
(ct,ss) = KyberEncDet(pkrecipient,coins), kstep = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/kyber-ss\0" ∥ss ,
(12)
where all hashing uses BLAKE3-256 with domain separation. Second-preimage resistance of
chained commitments prevents forks; SPHINCS+ ensures non-repudiation.
11.1 SPHINCS+ Ephemeral Keys Chained to Parent (Clockless)
Signatures (normative). Parameter set: SPHINCS+ BLAKE3, level = NIST Category
5, variant = ‘f‘ (fast). The DSM implementation uses BLAKE3 for all hash, PRF, and
thash operations within SPHINCS+ (not SHAKE). Receipts MUST admit a hard maximum
serialized size ≤128 KiB (including two signatures and included proof material). Submissions
exceeding the cap are invalid and MUST be rejected prior to proof verification.
Key derivation (normative). Let KDBRW be the DBRW binding (Sec. 12). KDBRW MUST
NEVER be serialized, logged, or included in any commitment. Derive a master seed using
HKDF-BLAKE3:
Smaster = HKDF-ExtractBLAKE3(salt= "DSM/dev\0", IKM= G∥DevID ∥KDBRW ∥s0),
(13)
and an attestation key (AKsk,AKpk) ←SPHINCS+.KeyGen(Smaster).
Given parent hn and precommit Cpre, derive the per-step seed
En+1 = HKDFBLAKE3("DSM/ek\0", hn ∥Cpre ∥kstep ∥KDBRW), (14)
then generate the ephemeral keypair (EKsk
n+1,EKpk
n+1).
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 27
Ephemeral certification (normative). Define the certification hash with domain separa-
tion
Hek-cert(X) := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/ek-cert\0" ∥X .
Certify the new key with the previous signer (AK for n=0, else EKn):
certn+1 = SignSKn
Hek-cert EKpk
n+1 ∥hn. (15)
Sign the receipt body with EKsk
n+1.
Verification (normative). checks inclusion proofs (Sec. 4.2).
Verification replays the chain of certificates back to AKpk and
11.2 Identity Pre-commitment
Let P0 be a provisioning seed; define Pi = BLAKE3-256("DSM/provision\0" ∥Pi−1). Under
collision resistance, adversaries cannot forge a different identity chain consistent with {Pi}
without breaking P0. For transport, commitments may be sealed via Kyber and verified upon
decryption by checking BLAKE3-256("DSM/commit\0" ∥Sn ∥P) = expected.
12 Dual-Binding Random Walk (DBRW)
Definition 1 (Hardware Entropy). H(d) ∈{0,1}n extracts device-specific microarchitectural
entropy.
Definition 2 (Environment Fingerprint). E(e) ∈{0,1}m fingerprints the execution environ-
ment.
Definition 3 (Dual-Binding).
KDBRW = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/dbrw-bind\0" ∥H(d) ∥E(e) ∥sdevice ,
where sdevice is a per-device salt ensuring uniqueness even for similar hardware or environ-
ments.
Theorem 5 (Binding Inseparability). Given KDBRW and collision resistance of BLAKE3-256
under domain separation, it is infeasible to find (h′,e′,s′) ̸= (h,e,s) such that BLAKE3-256("DSM/dbrw-bind
h′ ∥e′ ∥s′) = BLAKE3-256("DSM/dbrw-bind\0" ∥h ∥e ∥s). The per-device salt sdevice
prevents correlation attacks by ensuring unique bindings even when hardware entropy or
environment fingerprints are similar across devices.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 28
DBRW advances without clocks. The ρ/C recurrence is the abstract definition
of forward-only DBRW state evolution:
ρi = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/dbrw-rho\0" ∥Ci−1 ∥KDBRW , Ci = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/dbrw-step\0" ∥C
(16)
with nonce Ni (deterministically derived from adjacency inputs or obtained from a local
entropy source; it MUST NOT be time-based). Mixing KDBRW into key derivations binds all
signatures to the device and environment without introducing any external authority.

Realization (normative). Implementations MUST realize the per-step KDBRW
binding by mixing KDBRW into the per-step HKDF inputs that produce signing
material — not as a separately maintained ρ/C state walk. Specifically, the
per-step ephemeral seed (Eq. 14) and the deterministic Kyber coins (Sec. 11)
both fold KDBRW into their preimage:
  E_{n+1} = HKDF-BLAKE3("DSM/ek\0",   h_n ∥ C_pre ∥ k_step ∥ K_DBRW)
  coins   = BLAKE3-256("DSM/kyber-coins\0" ∥ h_n ∥ C_pre ∥ DevID ∥ K_DBRW)

Because every per-step seed inherits K_DBRW, advancing the chain is
equivalent to advancing the ρ/C recurrence; (16) is the abstract property
that emerges from this construction. A separate explicit ρ/C state walk is
NOT required — and implementations SHOULD NOT maintain one, since the
extra state would be redundant with the per-step seed and would create an
additional surface that must be kept consistent with the chain. The
"DSM/dbrw-rho\0" / "DSM/dbrw-step\0" tags exist as conceptual labels for
(16); the per-step HKDF mixing is the only normative realization.

(Implementations MAY use distinct domain tags such as "DSM/dbrw-rwp-*" for
unrelated DBRW-derived constructs, e.g., transaction-unlinkability random
walks over the public message space; those are not the §12 ρ/C recurrence
and do not satisfy the realization requirement above.)
Privacy Rule (normative): DBRW bindings MUST NOT be used for user identification,
tracking, or correlation. DBRW exists solely for anti-cloning protection and device binding;
all user-facing operations use DevID and genesis-based addressing.
13 Offline Recovery Protocol
After each accepted stitched receipt, the device writes an encrypted recovery capsule to offline
media (e.g., NFC, printed QR, removable storage) as an append-only stream. The capsule is
transport-agnostic; only its canonical plaintext and AEAD construction are normative.
Canonical plaintext (normative). Let ProtoDet(·) denote deterministic Protobuf encoding
(fixed field order, no unknown fields, no map iteration nondeterminism). Define the capsule
plaintext as:
Plaint := ProtoDet rt, Meta, {(DevID(8),hA↔Dev)}, Rollt, challenget, ct , (17)
where:
• ct is a monotone capsule index (local to the capsule stream; not a clock).
• rt is the Per-Device SMT root after accepting receipt t.
• DevID(8) are 8-byte truncated device digests used only for compact indexing; protocol
verification binds to full 32-byte DevIDs elsewhere.
• hA↔Dev are the current relationship chain tips for each listed device relationship.
• Rollt is an accumulator over accepted receipts (defined below).
• challenget binds the capsule to its creation context and prevents replay between streams.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 29
Key derivation (normative; mnemonic ring). Let the user supply a 24-word mnemonic.
Derive a fixed-length seed using a memory-hard KDF with fixed parameters (no time-based
tuning):
Smn := Argon2id "DSM/recovery-ring\0", mnemonic
_bytes,
then derive the AEAD key using HKDF-BLAKE3:
KR := HKDFBLAKE3 "DSM/recovery-aead\0", Smn.
(mnemonic
_bytes is the canonical wordlist encoding; implementations MUST NOT treat
locale or whitespace as significant.)
Nonce derivation (normative; clockless). AEAD nonces are derived deterministically
from the capsule index and the current roll:
noncet := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/recovery-nonce\0" ∥u64le(ct) ∥Rollt 0..23,
i.e., the first 24 bytes for XChaCha20-Poly1305. Nonce reuse is prevented by the monotone
ct.
Capsule encryption (normative). Use XChaCha20-Poly1305:
Captt = XChaCha20-Poly1305.EncKR, nonce=noncet Plaint; AD = "DSM/recovery-capsule-v3\0".
(18)
Roll accumulator (normative). Let Receiptt be the accepted stitched receipt bytes (trans-
port envelope excluded; hash the canonical commit form). Update:
Rollt+1 = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/recovery-roll\0" ∥Rollt ∥BLAKE3-256 "DSM/receipt\0" ∥Receiptt ∥
(19)
where DevID(8) and h′A↔Dev correspond to the relationship tip(s) touched by Receiptt. This
binds capsule order to accepted receipt history without clocks.
Challenge binding (normative). Derive:
challenget := BLAKE3-256 "DSM/recovery-challenge\0" ∥Rollt ∥rt ∥u64le(ct).
This prevents transplanting a capsule into a different stream or context without detection.

TombstoneandSuccession. Onloss, decryptthelatestcapsuletorecover(r⋆
,{(DevID(8),h)},Roll⋆
,c⋆).
Recovery proceeds in two deterministic operations under genesis G:
• Tombstone (TR). Publish a Device Tree update receipt that marks the lost device leaf
DevIDold as TOMBSTONED (a canonical leaf marker), producing a new Device Tree root R′
G.
TR is valid iff it is authorized by the recovery authority defined for G (e.g., threshold over
designated recovery devices) and is adjacent in the Device Tree update chain.
• Succession (SR). Publish a second Device Tree update receipt that inserts the new device
DevIDnew, producing R′′
G. SR references TR by digest and is valid only if TR is active (i.e.,
the tombstone marker is present in R′
G and TR has not been superseded).
Resumption of bilateral relationships. For each stored parent tip h in the decrypted
capsule, the new device resumes by proposing successors adjacent to h. Acceptance remains
unique parent consumption (Tripwire); no replay of full history is required. The recovered
Roll⋆ provides an integrity anchor for the recovered stream.
Security. Receipt uniqueness ensures at most one accepted successor per parent. AEAD plus
mnemonic hardness protect the capsule. Challenge binding prevents capsule replay between
contexts. After TR/SR, the old device cannot extend state: any attempt fails because its
DevID is tombstoned in the current Device Tree root and thus fails device-to-genesis binding
checks. The roll accumulator binds recovered state to the accepted receipt stream.
13.1 Modal Synchronization Precedence
If A performs a physical offline transaction with B, then B must incorporate that stitched
receipt before initiating a new offline transaction with A; otherwise B would attempt to
consume a different parent.
14 Genesis-Gated Emission Reveal and Deterministic Faucet Claims
This section replaces geo-emissions and geometry attestation. DSM emissions are
now specified as genesis-gated, CPTA-bound reveals sourced from a protocol DLV, with
optional faucet-style discovery implemented via a pinned spawn registry and deterministic
claim selection. There are no clocks, timestamps, or global ordering requirements.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 31
14.1 Source Vault (CPTA-Bound DLV) and Fixed Supply
Let policy_
commitROOT be the CPTA commitment for the native token. Let VROOT be a
special CPTA-bound DLV that holds the full fixed supply and is directly unspendable; value
can only leave via the emission-reveal transition predicate below.
The vault state includes:
supply_remaining, i, halving_epoch, vault
chain
_
_tip,
where i is the emission index (monotone, adjacency-updated) and vault
chain
_
_tip is the
straight-hash-chain tip for the vault’s own relationship domain (vault ↔storage anchoring
relationship).
14.2 Spend-Gate Trigger (PaidK) and Emission Indexing
Emission is triggered only when a new genesis Gnew passes the Spend Gate: the device proves
that at least K distinct assigned storage nodes have accepted the paid subscription state
required to store Gnew’s genesis objects (the PaidK gate). The proof is a stitched receipt
bundle over the subscription DLV(s) and node assignment roots.
Formally, define PaidK(Gnew) = 1 iff the verifier can validate K distinct, valid, adjacent
receipts showing the required paid storage commitments for Gnew.
On PaidK(Gnew) = 1, the protocol increments i := i+ 1 as part of the vault emission
transition.
14.3 Halving Schedule (Clockless)
Let H be the fixed halving interval in number of emissions (not time). Let base be the initial
per-emission amount. Define:
epoch(i) := i
H , amt(i) := base
2epoch(i).
The vault transition MUST reject if amt(i) = 0 while supply_remaining > 0 (parameter
mismatch), or if amt(i) >supply_remaining. Supply is reduced deterministically:
supply_remaining′= supply_remaining−amt(i).
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 32
14.4 Regional Mapping and Pinned Spawn Registry (Optional Discovery Layer)
Each emission is mapped to a coarse region identifier region_
id associated with Gnew (e.g.,
state/province class). The mapping is deterministic and coarse-grained; it is not a proof-of-
location system.
Let Rbe a pinned spawn registry with Merkle root Rootspawn. Each spawn entry is:
spawn = (spawn_id, region_id, cooldown_class, capacity, policy_commit).
The registry is an application-visible distribution map; protocol enforcement only requires
inclusion proofs under Rootspawn.
For emission index i, define a deterministic spawn selection inside the region:
spawn_id(i) := SelectSpawn BLAKE3-256 "DSM/emit-spawn\0" ∥u64le(i) ∥region_
id ∥Gnew , region_
i
where SelectSpawn(·) is a fixed, published selection function over the ordered spawn list for
region_
id.
14.5 Faucet Claim Capsule (Deterministic, No Geo-Attestation)
A claim is a one-shot capsule that binds the claimant to the spawn and to its current adjacency
state. Define:
capclaim = (spawn_id, Gclaimant, DevIDclaimant, chain_tip, C, σ, πspawn, policy_commit),
with:
C = BLAKE3-256 "DSM/faucet-claim\0" ∥spawn_id ∥Gclaimant ∥DevIDclaimant ∥chain_tip ∥policy_
com
and σ a SPHINCS+ signature under the claimant’s step key for chain_tip (Sec. 11.1). The
spawn inclusion proof πspawn proves spawn_id under Rootspawn.
Local-only gates: cooldown, proximity, and sensor checks (walk-and-claim UI behavior) are
device-local policy gates. They MUST NOT be treated as globally verified predicates in
this version of the spec. The protocol-level invariants are: (1) spawn authenticity via πspawn,
(2) device binding via signatures and DevID inclusion, and (3) capacity enforcement via
deterministic selection below.
14.6 Deterministic Capacity Enforcement (No Timestamps)
Let Cspawn be the set of valid claim commitments C for a spawn observed by verifiers. Define
a deterministic first-writer-wins selector:
FWWc(Cspawn) = the c lexicographically smallest C ∈Cspawn,
where c = capacity from the spawn entry. Only claims whose C lies in FWWc(Cspawn) are
eligible to be applied as emission recipients. This rule is purely set-based; no timestamps or
global ordering are referenced.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 33
14.7 Emission Application (Vault Transition)
Minting/reveal is an ordinary DSM token transition sourced from VROOT:
capclaim, PaidK(Gnew) −−−−−−−−−−−−−→V′
VROOT
ROOT
that transfers amt(i) from the vault to Gclaimant under policy_
commitROOT, updates i :=
i+ 1, and reduces supply_remaining. Replaying an already-consumed claim has no effect
(idempotence) because it would require consuming an already-consumed parent in the vault
transition domain (Tripwire).
Theorem 6 (Deterministic Capacity Enforcement). For any spawn with capacity c, across
all honest verifiers applying the same pinned spawn registry root and the same set Cspawn, only
claims with commitments in FWWc(Cspawn) can be applied as emission recipients, independent
of message ordering, timing, or network topology.
15 Security Analysis and System Properties
15.1 Why the CAP Theorem Does Not Apply
CAP presumes a single, globally shared object whose operations must trade off consistency,
availability, and partition tolerance. DSM rejects that premise: there is no monolithic global
state. Instead, DSM is a collection of independent bilateral relationships, each with its own
straight hash chain and Per-Device SMT head, stitched by countersigned receipts.
15.2 Local Predicates (Per Relationship)
Let Ri,j denote the relationship domain between devices i and j. We define, locally:
Ci,j ⇔ all receipts on Ri,j verify (signatures + inclusion proofs) and the chain has no forked successor,
Ai,j ⇔ each valid operation on Ri,j returns a deterministic non-error response (online or offline),
Pi,j ⇔ network partitions only transition Ri,j to offline mode; unrelated Rk,ℓ unaffected.
These predicates depend solely on hash adjacency and inclusion proofs; they do not reference
clocks or a global height.
15.3 Localized Feasibility (No Global Trade-off)
Theorem 7 (Per-Relationship CAP Feasibility). For every (i,j), DSM simultaneously
satisfies Ci,j, Ai,j, and Pi,j.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 34
Proof. Consistency: stitched receipts and collision resistance eliminate acceptable double
successors for the same parent (Tripwire), so Ci,j holds. Availability: each operation either
(a) completes online via b0x delivery into the counterparty’s Per-Device SMT pipeline, or (b)
completes offline via live co-signing; in both cases the response is deterministic, establishing
Ai,j. Partition tolerance: a partition only affects the ability of that pair to synchronize; all
other Rk,ℓ continue, so Pi,j holds. Because DSM does not attempt to maintain a global shared
object, the global CAP trade-off never arises.
15.4 System-Level Consequence
Since the system is the disjoint union of {Ri,j}, the classical CAP impossibility is out of
scope. DSM achieves consistency, availability, and partition tolerance within each relationship
domain—the only domain where the predicates are semantically meaningful in DSM.
15.5 Bifurcation Resistance and Pre-Sign Commitments
Mandatory pre-sign commitments Cpre lock parameters; forging conflicting successors requires
a hash collision or signature forgery. Offline bilateral exchanges realize the same security via
proximity channels.
15.6 Non-Repudiation and Causal Ordering
Countersigned receipts are undeniable; causal ordering emerges from parent embedding and
Per-Device/Device Tree inclusion proofs.
15.7 Anti-Cloning Guarantees
DBRW binds state to both hardware and environment; without KDBRW, extending state is
infeasible.
15.8 Offline Liveness and Recovery
Thecapsule+TR/SRschemeenablesimmediateresumptionafterdeviceloss; per-relationship
parents allow constructing successors without replaying history; the roll accumulator anchors
recovered state integrity.
15.9 Additional Guarantees
Auditing can enumerate stitched digests between indices; proofs remain logarithmic. Reputa-
tion or rate-limits can be computed from local deterministic counters or bounded windows
orthogonal to acceptance rules.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 35
16 System Architecture and Implementation
This section is a drop-in replacement that specifies the complete DSM system design for the
current mobile-first SDK. Android (NDK/JNI) is the reference target, but the SDK is defined
as cross-platform. It ties the cryptographic model to concrete code structure, transport, and
mobile integration, while retaining all prior protocol invariants (no global consensus, no wall
clocks or heights, bilateral isolation, inclusion proofs only).
16.1 Codebase Layout and Roles
Rust Core (dsm_core) Single source of truth for all state transition rules, cryptography,
and verification. It is transport-agnostic and exposes stable ABI surfaces for mobile and
other bindings.
• core/: Genesis/device creation, relationship (pair) straight-hash-chains, Per-Device SMT
maintenance, Device Tree verification.
• crypto/: Post-quantum primitives (Kyber KEM, SPHINCS+ signatures), BLAKE3,
HKDF-BLAKE3, Argon2id, AEAD.
• receipt/: Stitched receipts, inclusion proofs, canonical commit bytes, Tripwire enforce-
ment.
• bilateral/: Offline co-sign flow (BLE/NFC transport-agnostic), conflict detection, local
apply.
• unilateral/: Online unilateral submit/retrieve using b0x[...] spool keys.
• recovery/: Tombstone/Succession, recovery capsule AEAD stream, DLV primitives
relevant to recovery predicates.
• bridge/: FFI/JNI surface; protobuf-in/protobuf-out, no re-encoding of commits.
16.2 SDK Architecture and Build Targets
Scope and authority (normative). The Rust protocol core crate dsm_core is the sole
execution authority for: (1) canonical commit bytes, (2) acceptance predicates, (3) Merkle
and SMT inclusion proof verification, (4) Per-Device SMT replace semantics, (5) signature
creation/verification, and (6) all KDFs (HKDF-BLAKE3, Argon2id). Platform SDKs and
bindings are non-authoritative shims that MUST delegate these operations to dsm_core and
MUST NOT re-implement canonical encodings or predicates.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 36
16.2.1 SDK repository (language-agnostic)
The SDK refers to the cross-platform repository DSM_SDK, which packages bindings, transport
schemas(.proto), anddevelopertoolingarounddsm_core. TheSDKisdefinedindependently
of any one platform.
16.2.2 Android target (NDK/JNI) and app
The Rust core compiles into an Android native shared library (NDK). Kotlin/Java call into
Rust via JNI. The Android app may embed a React/TypeScript WebView UI and route all
requests through a single auditable bridge.
• NDK: cargo-ndk builds libdsm.so for all target ABIs; exported symbols are C/JNI
ABI-stable and versioned.
• JNIwrapper: DsmNativeWrapper.ktexposesaminimalsurface: init_device,submit_online,
co_sign_offline, verify_receipt, get_per_device_root, prove_incl.
• Hardware shim: Kotlin mediates BLE/NFC, GNSS/UI sensors, and storage I/O;
dsm_core never touches Android SDK objects directly.
• WebView bridge: the frontend emits/receives length-prefixed binary Protobuf envelopes
(e.g. Uint8Array) through a single bridge. Kotlin converts between WebView binary buffers
and Rust FFI buffers. No JSON, no base64, and no hex encodings are used on
the protocol path.
16.2.3 React/TypeScript frontend
UI-only. ProtobuftypesaregeneratedforTypeScripttoensureschemaparitywithRust/Kotlin.
Commits and signatures are always computed by dsm_core, never in the UI. The frontend
manipulates opaque binary envelopes and human-readable views; it never re-derives protocol
hashes.
16.2.4 Build matrix and targets
• Core: dsm_core (Rust) is the single execution engine.
• SDK repo: DSM_SDKpublishes bindings for Android (NDK/JNI), iOS (.a/.xcframework),
Web (WASM), and desktop (static/shared libs).
• Android: one build target; the SDK remains platform-agnostic.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 37
16.2.5 Binding constraints (normative)
• Bindings MUST call dsm_core for canonical commit emission, receipt verification, inclusion
proof verification, SMT replace, signatures, and all KDFs.
• Bindings MUST NOT hash/sign re-encoded payload bytes; they MUST pass canonical
commit bytes emitted by dsm_core (Sec. 16.5).
• Versioning is pinned: application code depends on DSM_SDK@v , which pins dsm_core@v ;
semantic upgrades are coordinated and explicit.
• Encoding ban: JSON, base64, hex, and Serde-derived canonicalization are forbidden
on the protocol path (wire, storage keys used for protocol addressing, and acceptance
predicates).
Storage Nodes Storage nodes are dumb, signature-free persistence surfaces. They store
Device Tree material, Per-Device SMT mirrors (aggregated), b0x spools, ByteCommit chains,
and recovery capsules. They do not evaluate acceptance predicates. Validation is device-side;
nodes persist and serve bytes. Censorship resistance derives from replication plus client-side
verification.
16.3 Two Merkle Structures (No Renames)
Device Tree (standard Merkle, normative). A standard Merkle tree whose root is the
Device Tree root RG, constructed from the owner’s device identifiers. It binds every device
of the same owner to RG and is replicated on all user devices and storage nodes.
Leaves. Leaves are 32-byte DevID values sorted lexicographically (big-endian byte order).
Internal nodes. For left child L and right child R,
Hdev(L,R) := BLAKE3 "DSM/dev-merkle\0" ∥L∥R .
Empty tree root.
R∅
G := BLAKE3 "DSM/dev-empty\0".
Per-Device SMT (sparse). For each device, a Per-Device Sparse Merkle Tree indexes that
device’s bilateral relationships; leaves store the current relationship chain tip digest hA↔B
per counterparty key. Other devices do not mirror this SMT; storage nodes may keep concise
aggregated mirrors. Receipts always carry inclusion proofs against relevant SMT roots.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 38
16.4 Addressing and Online Unilateral Transport (b0x[...])
Purpose. b0x is a fixed literal prefix that marks an online/unilateral submission spool key.
Offline bilateral exchanges never use b0x; they require live proximity transport (BLE/NFC)
and immediate co-signature.
Key format (normative; no hex/base64). The b0x key is a string key for storage indexing
only; it is not a verification primitive. It is formed by base32 encoding (Crockford base32,
uppercase, no padding) of three 32-byte digests:
addrA→B := b0x[B32 BLAKE3 "DSM/addr-G\0" ∥G∥saltG.B32 BLAKE3 "DSM/addr-D\0" ∥DevID
Here hn is the current relationship chain tip digest for (A↔B), and nonce is sender-chosen
per submission. B32(·) is a pure text encoding; it carries no security assumptions.
Salt derivation (normative). exposed:
Per-user blinding salts are derived inside dsm_core and never
saltG := HKDFBLAKE3 "DSM/b0x-salt-G\0", Smaster , saltD := HKDFBLAKE3 "DSM/b0x-salt-D\0", Sm
where Smaster is the device’s master secret seed (Sec. 11.1).
Rotation and privacy. Each stitched receipt advancing (A↔B) changes hn, rotating the
final component and thus the full b0x[...] key. Only counterparties tracking the live tip
can derive the current spool key; storage nodes store opaque bytes keyed by b0x[...] and
learn no relationship metadata from blinded components.
Retrieval and stitching. Upon sync, Bderives the current key from (G,DevIDB,hn), fetches
pending submissions stored under that key, verifies receipts (inclusion proofs, certificates,
signatures), and stitches them to advance the tip. Submissions addressed to older tips are
queued (waiting predecessors) or rejected as invalid against the current state.
Modal lock (relationship-local). If any pending online submission exists for (A,B) under
the latest derived b0x[...] key (including the local queue), offline (A,B) transactions are
invalid until those pending items are synchronized and either stitched or rejected. Other
relationships are unaffected.
No clocks, no heights. Address derivation and admissibility are purely hash-chain driven.
No wall clocks, timestamps, epochs, or heights appear in any predicate.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 39
16.5 Canonical Encoding and Protobuf Pipeline
DSM is protobuf-only on all authoritative paths. The system distinguishes: (i) transport
envelopes (protobuf messages for network/app plumbing), and (ii) canonical commit bytes
(protobuf messages with strict determinism rules emitted only by dsm_core).
• Transport: Protobuf envelopes only (Envelope wire v3). Schemas are defined in canonical
.proto and code-generated for Rust/Kotlin/TypeScript.
• Canonical commit bytes (normative): Every hashed/signed object has a CommitV3
protobuf form with: (a) no map fields, (b) all repeated fields either preserved in protocol-
defined order or explicitly lexicographically sorted, (c) no unknown fields, (d) fixed domain
tags, and (e) deterministic encoding produced by dsm_core. All hashing/signing is over
these commit bytes, never over ad-hoc re-encodings.
• Bindings: Platform code forwards opaque commit bytes produced by dsm_core; it does
not re-encode commits.
• Terminology: Use “inclusion proof” everywhere (never “membership proof”).
• Encoding ban: JSON/base64/hex are forbidden on the protocol path (wire verification,
commit hashing, receipt signing, storage addressing keys).
16.6 Ordering and Concurrency (No Clocks, No Heights)
DSM uses the bilateral straight hash chain itself for strict ordering; no timestamps or heights
appear in any predicate. Concurrency is resolved by stitched receipts and Per-Device SMT
replace:
1. Each proposed successor at tip hn carries a pre-commit Cpre = BLAKE3 "DSM/pre\0" ∥
hn ∥op ∥e and an inclusion proof that hn is the current Per-Device SMT leaf.
2. The successor hn+1 = BLAKE3 "DSM/tip\0" ∥hn ∥op ∥e∥σ is accepted iff the stitched
receipt validates and the Per-Device SMT replace hn →hn+1 recomputes the advertised
new root r′
A with valid inclusion proofs (old and new).
3. Any concurrent attempt consuming the same hn that is not bit-identical is rejected by the
device-local SMT replace rule (Tripwire).
Deterministic rate limits without time (optional, non-consensus). Policies may impose
counter-based limits (e.g., per-relationship step counters) and/or work-unit gates defined as a
fixed number of BLAKE3 iterations. These are strictly local predicates or vault predicates
parameterized by integers, never by wall time. No calibration against time is permitted.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 40
16.7 Key Management, DBRW Binding, and SPHINCS+
Per-step key derivation is specified in Sec. 11.1 and Sec. 12. In summary:
• Device-bound secret KDBRW derives from hardware and environment (DBRW) and is never
serialized, logged, or committed.
• Master seed Smaster derives via HKDF-BLAKE3 from (G,DevID,KDBRW,s0).
• For each parent hn and pre-commit Cpre, a per-step seed En+1 derives via HKDF-BLAKE3
from (hn,Cpre,kstep,KDBRW), where kstep is derived from Kyber shared secret material.
• Ephemeral SPHINCS+ keys are deterministically generated from En+1 and certified by
the previous key (AK or prior EK).
No long-term signing key is exposed at the protocol layer; all signatures are ephemeral and
chained to the parent and DBRW binding.
Receipts (Per-Device SMT replace). For (A↔B) at tip hn, a stitched receipt carries:
(i) old/new tips (hn,hn+1), (ii) old/new Per-Device SMT roots (rA,r′
A) (and symmetrically
rB,r′
B when required), (iii) inclusion proofs for the old and new leaves, (iv) Device Tree
inclusion for signing DevIDs under RG, (v) the EK certificate chain data, and (vi) two
SPHINCS+ signatures over the canonical commit bytes of the receipt body. If any inclusion
proof fails or SMT replace does not recompute the advertised root, the receipt is invalid.
16.8 Offline vs. Online Flows
Offline (bilateral, co-sign live). Devices exchange Cpre, verify inclusion proofs locally,
derive per-step keys, co-sign the receipt, and each applies the Per-Device SMT replace. No
storage node is required for finality.
Online (unilateral, b0x[...] spool). Sender posts a unilateral submission to the derived
b0x[...] key. The recipient syncs, verifies proofs and signatures, then stitches and applies.
The relationship-local modal lock forbids starting an offline transaction for (A,B) while
pending online projections exist for (A,B).
16.9 Storage Nodes and Censorship Resistance
Storage nodes expose protobuf-only endpoints to store/fetch: (i) Device Tree material and
roots, (ii) Per-Device SMT mirrors (aggregated), (iii) b0x[...] spool items, (iv) recovery
capsules, and (v) ByteCommit chains.
Nodes never validate acceptance predicates. Censorship resistance follows from: (1) client-side
verification of all fetched bytes and proofs, (2) deterministic replica placement and PaidK
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 41
gates (Sec. 10), and (3) multi-node replication: if one node refuses, the same self-verifying
protobuf object is relayed to other nodes.
16.10 Recovery Capsule AEAD and DLV
Recovery capsules are defined in Sec. 13. This subsection pins implementation choices for the
SDK.
AEAD choice (normative). Use XChaCha20-Poly1305 with a 256-bit key KR derived from
the mnemonic ring key derivation, and a 24-byte nonce derived deterministically from the
capsule counter and roll accumulator (Sec. 13).
Associated data (normative).
AD := "DSM/recovery-capsule-v3\0" ∥rt ∥u64le(ct).
Associated data is authenticated but not encrypted; it binds the capsule to the current
Per-Device SMT root and capsule index without clocks.
Nonce uniqueness (normative). Nonce reuse is forbidden. Uniqueness is enforced by
monotone counter ct per capsule stream and deterministic nonce derivation under KR.
16.11 Build, Tooling, and Generation Pipeline
• Rust workspace: cargo build -locked -workspace -all-features.
• AndroidNDK:cargo-ndk -t armeabi-v7a -t arm64-v8a -t x86_64 -o ./android/app/src/mai
build -r.
• JNI: Minimal surface in DsmNativeWrapper.kt; all parameter validation and all crypto-
graphic operations occur in Rust.
• Protobuf: Generate Rust/Kotlin/TypeScript types from the canonical .proto. Envelope
wire is pinned to v3 only.
• Frontend: pnpm build; assets bundled into Android assets for WebView.
• Testing: Rust unit/integration tests for SMT replace and receipt verification; Android
instrumentation tests for BLE/NFC shims; end-to-end tests proving offline/online parity
for the same relationship domain.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 42
16.12 Operational Parameters (Recommended)
• Hash: BLAKE3 (256-bit digests) for commits and deterministic counters.
• Signatures: SPHINCS+ (per-step, deterministic derivation; size capped as specified in
Sec. 11.1).
• KEM: Kyber for step secrets; secrets never serialized.
• SMT: 256-bit key space; inclusion proofs logarithmic; device-local authoritative.
• Device Tree: Standard Merkle; replicated to storage nodes and user devices.
• Entropy: s0 andsdevice fromCSPRNG;per-stepseedsviaHKDF-BLAKE3over(hn,Cpre,kstep,KDBRW).
• Time: No timestamps, epochs, or heights in predicates or encodings.
• Modal rule: Pending online for (A,B) blocks offline for (A,B) until synchronized; other
relationships commute.
Summary. DSM’s implementation is mobile-first: Rust compiles into an Android native
library (NDK), invoked through a thin JNI layer, and surfaced to a React UI via a single
bridge. Transport uses protobuf (Envelope v3). All cryptographic commits are canonical
protobuf commit bytes emitted and verified solely by dsm_core. Ordering is enforced by
bilateral hash adjacency and Per-Device SMT replace, not by time or height. SPHINCS+ is
per-step and deterministically derived with Kyber and DBRW binding.
17 Conclusion
DSM is a clockless bilateral trust fabric with two Merkle layers: a replicated Device Tree
that binds DevIDs to a single genesis, and a Per-Device SMT that indexes relationship
domains and their linear straight hash chains. Ordering is enforced solely by hash adjacency.
Receipts carry inclusion proofs and post-quantum signatures; ephemeral SPHINCS+ keys are
chained to the parent and bound to the device via DBRW. Online delivery is deterministic
via b0x[...] spool keys; offline is bilateral live-sign. The result is robust, scalable, and
suitable for large-scale deployment.

18 Worked Examples (Alice, Bob, Carol)
This section gives concrete, implementation-ready traces that exercise DSM’s core flows: (1)
offline bilateral (co-sign live), (2) online unilateral via b0x[...], (3) DLV + deterministic
smart commitments with an external commitment, and (4) a three-party choreography
(Alice-Bob-Carol) realized as composable bilateral updates. Transport is always Protobuf;
all cryptographic commits use the canonical commit form (Sec. 4.2.1).
Normative Authority (core vs. SDK). The Rust protocol core crate dsm_core is
the sole source of truth for: canonical commit bytes, acceptance predicates, Merkle proof
verification, SMT replace semantics, and signature/KDF logic. Language SDKs/bindings
are non-authoritative shims that MUST forward requests to dsm_core and MUST NOT
re-encode canonical commits or re-implement validation logic.
We use the following fixed notations throughout:
GA,GB,GC ∈{0,1}256 (genesis digests)
DevIDA,DevIDB,DevIDC ∈{0,1}256
H := BLAKE3-256, SPX := SPHINCS+ (BLAKE3, Cat-5, f)
Key(A,B) := H("DSM/smt-key\0" ∥min(DevIDA,DevIDB) ∥max(DevIDA,DevIDB))
kA↔B := Key(A,B), ZERO_LEAF := 0x0032
Per-Device SMT roots: rA,rB,rC
Relationship tip digests: hA↔B
n for step n
18.1 State Snapshot (before any example)
On device A (Alice):
Leaf key kA↔B = Key(A,B), Inclusion proof πrel(hA↔B
n ∈rA)
πdev(DevIDA ∈RGA ) (Device Tree proof)
Leaf value vA↔B = hA↔B
n
Bob’s device B holds the symmetric view for (A,B) with its own Per-Device SMT root rB
and parent hA↔B
n.
For brevity in the examples below, we often write hn when the relationship is clear from
context; formally this is hA↔B
n for the (A,B) bilateral domain, and analogously for (A,C) or
(B,C).
18.2 Example 1: Offline Bilateral Transfer (Bluetooth/NFC)
Goal: Alice transfers α tokens to Bob offline. Both are co-present.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 47
Step 1: Pre-commit. Alice proposes operation op = Transfer(α) with entropy e,
Cpre = H hA↔B
n ∥op ∥e .
Step 2: Per-step keys (clockless). Each device derives per-step material exactly as
in Sec. 16.7, using only already-committed inputs; no timestamps or heights. Concretely,
both sides invoke the normative per-step KDF with parent tip hA↔B
n and pre-commit Cpre,
obtaining the SPHINCS+ ephemeral keypair
(EKsk
n+1,EKpk
n+1).
No long-term signing key is exposed at the protocol layer; the per-step key is deterministically
bound to (hA↔B
n ,Cpre) and the device’s DBRW binding.
Step 3: Successor state and balance update. the balance delta ∆A =−α,∆B = +α (Sec. 8), then
hA↔B
n+1 = H(Sn+1).
Alice builds Sn+1 embedding hA↔B
n and
Step 4: SMT replace (on both devices). Each device locally performs
r′
A = SMT-Replace(rA,kA↔B : hn →hn+1), r′
B = SMT-Replace(rB,kA↔B : hn →hn+1).
Step 5: Stitched receipt (co-sign live). then both sign:
Form canonical commit bytes as in Sec. 4.2.1,
τA↔B = enc... , σA = SPX.SignEKsk
n+1,A (commit), σB = SPX.SignEKsk
n+1,B (commit).
Both devices accept upon verifying signatures and proofs; the tip advances to hn+1. No
storage node or b0x is involved.
Acceptance (deterministic). Verify: (1) SPX sigs, (2) inclusion proofs old/new leaves,
(3) Device Tree proof for DevIDA, (4) SMT replace recomputes r′
A/r′
B, (5) token invariant
BA,n+1 ≥0. If any fails ⇒reject.
18.3 Example 2: Online Unilateral Delivery via b0x[...]
Goal: Alice initiates a send while Bob is offline. Alice submits a candidate; Bob later stitches
if adjacent.
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 48
Step 1: Address derivation (blinded, tip-rotating).
addrA→B = b0x[H("DSM/addr-G\0" ∥GB ∥saltG)0..31 ; H("DSM/addr-D\0" ∥DevIDB ∥saltD)0..31 ; H("D
Only Alice and Bob know the live tip; storage nodes cannot correlate relationships.
Step 2: Submission. Alice posts a Protobuf envelope Ekeyed under addrA→B containing
the candidate successor, proofs, and Alice’s SPX signature over the canonical commit bytes.
Storage nodes persist; they do not validate.
Step3: Stitchingonsync(Bob). WhenBobcomesonline, hederivesaddrA→B fromhisGB,
DevIDB, and current hA↔B
n ; fetches pending E; verifies proofs and signatures; recomputes
r′
B = SMT-Replace(...). If valid, Bob countersigns to produce the stitched receipt and
advances to hn+1.
Modal lock (relationship-local). If any pending online submission exists for (A,B), a new
offline transaction for (A,B) is invalid until stitched; other pairs are unaffected.
18.4 Example 3: DLV + Smart Commitments + External Commitment
Goal: Alice escrows tokens in a Deterministic Limbo Vault (DLV) to Bob, to be released only
if an external condition X is met (e.g., hash of a delivery attestation). No Turing-complete
VM; purely deterministic commitments.
DLV configuration (commit-only).
V = (L,C,H), C= {require_X, deadline_proof}, X= H("DSM/ext\0" ∥attestation-bytes).
Alice publishes a receipt that commits to V and moves the escrowed amount from her free
balance to the vault balance. This is a normal stitched receipt with a smart commitment
clause referencing X (no oracle execution).
Satisfying C. Bob produces stitched receipts carrying inclusion of X (as a pure hash value—
the external data itself is not trusted) and the required co-signature from Alice acknowledging
satisfaction. The proof-of-completion σ is the minimal stitched evidence set that references
X and the DLV commit.
Unlock key derivation (deterministic).
skV = H(L∥C ∥σ).
No clocks. If C is never satisfied, the DLV remains locked; recovery/refund can be expressed
as a mutually exclusive pre-commit branch (below).
DSM: Deterministic State Machines 49
Pre-commit forking (mutually exclusive outcomes). same parent:
Alice prepares two branches at the
Crelease
pre
= H(hn ∥release ∥e1), Crefund
pre
= H(hn ∥refund ∥e2).
Tripwire guarantees only one successor can be accepted. If X is presented and co-signed,
release stitches; otherwise the mutually exclusive refund branch may stitch after a deter-
ministic iteration budget window (Sec. 16.6)—still clockless.
18.5 Example 4: Three-Party Choreography (Alice, Bob, Carol)
DSM remains bilateral at the protocol layer; multi-party logic is composed via coordinated
bilateral receipts and shared external commitments.
Scenario. Carol is the beneficiary if both Alice and Bob attest to condition Y (e.g., Carol
delivered service to each). Each pair runs its own bilateral chain: (A↔C) and (B ↔C),
with a shared external commitment
Y= H("DSM/ext\0" ∥delivery-proof).
Phase 1: Lock by Alice and Bob. Independently, Alice and Bob each create a DLV transfer
to Carol with conditions that reference the same Y:
VA : CA = {require_Y, A-ack}, VB : CB = {require_Y, B-ack}.
These are stitched on (A↔C) and (B ↔C), respectively. No 3-party signature is required;
only bilateral receipts exist.
Phase 2: Satisfaction and release. Carol (or Alice/Bob) presents Y in each bilateral
relationship. If Carol correctly performed, Alice co-signs A-ack with Y and Bob co-signs
B-ack with Y. Each bilateral domain produces its σ, so the two DLVs independently derive
their unlock keys:
skVA
= H(LA ∥CA ∥σA), skVB
= H(LB ∥CB ∥σB).
Funds release to Carol occur in two stitched receipts, one per pair; there is no global consensus
or 3-party ledger. If one side fails (e.g., Bob disagrees), Alice’s path can still independently
release or refund under her own mutually exclusive pre-commit branches.
Consistency and safety. At no point can conflicting successors consume the same parent
in any bilateral domain (Tripwire). No clocks are used. External data never executes; only
commitments to its digest are referenced.

18.6 Canonical Protobuf Transport (Illustrative Snippet)
Transport messages are Protobuf; cryptographic commits are canonical commit bytes emitted
by the Rust core crate dsm_core (e.g., a fixed-length, length-prefixed CBOR layout).
Listing 2: Protobuf envelope (illustrative transport fields only; commits are canonical bytes
from the Rust core)
message StitchedReceipt {
bytes genesis = 1; // 32B
bytes dev_id_a = 2; // 32B
bytes dev_id_b = 3; // 32B
bytes parent_tip = 4; // 32B
bytes child_tip = 5; // 32B
bytes parent_root = 6; // 32B
bytes child_root = 7; // 32B
bytes rel_proof_prev = 8; // opaque proof bytes (canonical encoding inside)
bytes rel_proof_next = 9; // opaque proof bytes (canonical encoding inside)
bytes dev_proof = 10; // opaque proof bytes (canonical encoding inside)
bytes sig_a = 11; // SPHINCS+ signature (over canonical commit bytes)
bytes sig_b = 12; // SPHINCS+ signature (over canonical commit bytes)
}
Normative reminder. Never hash/sign the Protobuf bytes. Always hash/sign the canonical
commit bytes (Sec. 4.2.1) produced by dsm_core; Protobuf is transport only. SDKs/bindings
MUST treat dsm_coreas the authority and MUST NOT alter commit encodings or predicates.
JSON and base64 are forbidden on the protocol path.
18.7 What Acceptors Must Check (All Examples)
Given any claimed successor, an acceptor MUST:
1. Verify SPX signatures against the canonical commit bytes.
2. Verify inclusion proofs for (hn ∈r) and (hn+1 ∈r′).
3. Verify DevID inclusion in the Device Tree (RG).
4. Recompute Per-Device SMT replace and match r′ byte-exactly.
5. Enforce token invariants (Bn+1 ≥0; supply conservation).
6. Enforce modal lock for (A,B) if pending online exists.
7. Enforce receipt size ≤128 KiB (signatures + proofs).
8. Reject any indefinite-length or non-canonical encoding for proofs; determinism is required.

Result. These examples cover: offline bilateral, online unilateral, DLV lifecycle with mutu-
ally exclusive pre-commit branches, an external commitment, and a composed three-party
outcome—all realized by stitched, clockless, bilateral receipts with Merkle inclusion proofs
and SPX signatures, with dsm_core as the single execution authority.
