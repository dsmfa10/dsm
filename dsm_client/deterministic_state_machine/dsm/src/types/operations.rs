//! State transition operations for the DSM protocol.
//!
//! This module defines [`Operation`], the enum representing every kind of state
//! transition the protocol supports -- from identity creation and token transfers
//! to bilateral relationship management and recovery flows.
//!
//! Operations are encoded to canonical, deterministic byte representations for
//! inclusion in state hashes and Envelope v3 payloads. No JSON or serde is used
//! on the canonical path; all encoding uses length-prefixed binary with fixed
//! variant tags.
//!
//! Trait hierarchies ([`Ops`], [`IdOps`], [`TokenOps`], [`GenericOps`],
//! [`SmartCommitOps`]) provide domain-specific validation and execution
//! interfaces that [`Operation`] implements.
