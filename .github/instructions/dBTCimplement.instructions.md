A Formal Withdrawal Model for dBTC with Policy-Bound In-Flight
Conversion

March 19, 2026
This document formalizes the DSM withdrawal model for dBTC under policy-bound in-flight conversion,
with explicit supply-state transitions, compatibility requirements, executable settlement conditions,
successor-vault admission rules, and terminal resolution semantics.
Formal Withdrawal Model with Policy-Bound In-Flight Conversion
Definition 1 (Policy-Class Supply State). Fix a CPTA policy class P . Let
SP (t) ∈N, FP (t) ∈N, TP (t) := SP (t) + FP (t),
where:
• SP (t) is the spendable dBTC supply in DSM at state t,
• FP (t) is the in-flight dBTC supply in DSM at state t,
• TP (t) is the total DSM-side dBTC supply for policy class P.
Each dBTC unit in class P is, at every protocol state, in exactly one of the following mutually
exclusive states:
Spendable, InFlight, Burned.
Invariant 1 (Supply Conservation). For every policy class P and every DSM state t,
TP (t) = SP (t) + FP (t),
and TP may change only through protocol-authorized mint or final-burn transitions.
Definition 2 (Compatible Limbo Vault Set). For each policy class P , let
VP (t)
denote the set of live limbo vaults advertising compatibility with P at state t. A vault v is compatible
with P iff its Bitcoin-side spend predicate, collateral form, and settlement constraints satisfy the
CPTA requirements defining P.
Definition 3 (Withdrawal Intent). A withdrawal intent is a tuple
w = id(w), P (w), a(w), addrBTC(w),
where:
1
• id(w) is a unique withdrawal identifier,
• P (w) is the CPTA policy class of the committed dBTC,
• a(w) ∈N \{0}is the withdrawal amount,
• addrBTC(w) is the Bitcoin destination address.
Definition 4 (Withdrawal Admissibility). A withdrawal intent w is admissible at DSM state t iff
Admissible(w, t) := a(w) ≤SP (w)(t) ∧Unique id(w) ∧ValidPolicy P (w) ∧ValidBTCAddress addrBTC(w).
Definition 5 (In-Flight Commitment). If w is admissible at state t, then DSM may perform the
withdrawal-commit transition
Commit(w) : t →t′
,
defined by
SP (w)(t′) = SP (w)(t)−a(w), FP (w)(t′) = FP (w)(t) + a(w),
with all other policy-class balances unchanged except as required by protocol bookkeeping, and with
commitment record
C(w) = Committed.
Definition 6 (In-Flight Tumbler). Let w be a committed withdrawal intent. The in-flight tumbler
of w, denoted
Θ(w),
is the withdrawal-specific execution state induced by DSM-side commitment of amount a(w) under
policy class P (w). It is not the circulating token as such; rather, it is the committed conversion of
that token amount from spendable state into in-flight state.
Definition 7 (Witness Completion Material). Let w be committed and let v ∈VP (w)(t). The
witness-completion material for (w, v) is
U (w, v) := Derive Θ(w), P (w), v ,
where Derive is the protocol-deterministic derivation function.
Requirement 1 (Policy-Bound Derivation). For every committed withdrawal w and every vault v,
U (w, v) is defined only if
v ∈VP (w)(t).
Equivalently, witness-completion material is derivable only against a limbo vault compatible with the
same CPTA policy class as the committed in-flight dBTC.
Definition 8 (Executable Withdrawal Predicate). Let
Exec(w, v)
denote the predicate that the Bitcoin spend path of vault v is validly satisfiable using U (w, v) for
withdrawal w. Then withdrawal w is executable at state t iff
Executable(w, t) := C(w) = Committed ∧∃v ∈VP (w)(t) Exec(w, v).

Definition 9 (Bilateral Conversion Guard). The conversion of dBTC from DSM-side fungible
balance into Bitcoin-side settlement authority is guarded bilaterally. A withdrawal w may advance
toward settlement only if both of the following hold:
C(w) = Committed
DSM-side supply conversion
∧ ∃v ∈VP (w)(t) Exec(w, v)
Bitcoin-side executable collateral
.
Thus neither DSM-side commitment alone nor Bitcoin-side collateral availability alone is sufficient.
Definition 10 (Withdrawal Bitcoin Spend). Let
BitcoinSpend(w)
denote the predicate that the committed withdrawal w has been validly realized by a Bitcoin transaction
satisfying the protocol-defined spend path for some compatible vault v ∈VP (w), with an output paying
a(w) to addrBTC(w).
Definition 11 (Split Withdrawal and Successor Vault). A withdrawal may be either:
• full, consuming the selected vault with no remainder, or
• split, producing both
Outuser(w) = a(w), addrBTC(w)
and a remainder output encoded as a successor vault
v+(w).
Whenever a successor vault v+(w) exists, it is a newly created Bitcoin-side collateral object under
the same CPTA policy class P (w), distinct from the user payout output.
Definition 12 (Vault Admission Depth). Let dmin(P ) denote the canonical burial depth required
for admission of a Bitcoin-side vault into the DSM-recognized live collateral set for policy class P.
Definition 13 (Successor Admission Predicate). Let v+(w) be the successor vault produced by a
split withdrawal, when such a successor exists. Define
Admitted v+(w) := BitcoinUTXO v+(w) ∧ depth(v+(w)) ≥dmin(P (w)).
If no successor vault is produced, this predicate is vacuous.
Definition 14 (Withdrawal Resolution). A committed withdrawal w resolves on the withdrawal
side when
Resolved(w) := BitcoinSpend(w).
This resolution condition concerns only the user-directed Bitcoin payout. It is independent of whether
any successor vault has yet satisfied the burial rule for re-admission into the collateral grid.
Definition 15 (Final Burn Transition). If Resolved(w) holds for a committed withdrawal w, DSM
performs the final-burn transition
FP (w) := FP (w)−a(w),
3
sets
C(w) := Finalized,
and records
FinalBurn(w) = ⊤.
No corresponding restoration to SP (w) occurs.
If the withdrawal is split and produces a successor vault v+(w), that successor is not included in the
live redeemable collateral set until
Admitted v+(w)
holds.
Definition 16 (Refund Transition). If a committed withdrawal w fails to achieve BitcoinSpend(w)
under protocol-defined failure conditions, DSM performs the refund transition
FP (w) := FP (w)−a(w), SP (w) := SP (w) + a(w),
sets
C(w) := Refunded,
and records
Refunded(w) = ⊤.
Invariant 2 (Single Resolution). For every withdrawal intent w,
¬ FinalBurn(w) ∧Refunded(w).
Equivalently, no committed withdrawal may resolve both by final burn and by refund.
Invariant 3 (No Double Spendable Claim). For every policy class P and every withdrawal w
with P (w) = P , once Commit(w) occurs, the amount a(w) is excluded from spendable balance until
exactly one of the two terminal transitions occurs:
FinalBurn(w) or Refunded(w).
Hence DSM never permits the same dBTC amount to remain simultaneously spendable and re-
deemable.
Invariant 4 (Successor Burial Before Re-Admission). For every split withdrawal w producing
successor vault v+(w),
¬Admitted v+(w) ⇒ v+(w) / ∈VP (w)(t).
Equivalently, a successor vault may exist on Bitcoin before burial, but it is not re-admitted into the
DSM live collateral set until the canonical admission depth is reached.
Proposition 1 (Formal Characterization of the In-Flight Tumbler). A circulating dBTC unit is
not itself the missing Bitcoin-side witness component. Rather, upon DSM withdrawal commitment,
the corresponding amount is converted into an in-flight state
Θ(w),
derived under CPTA policy class P (w), and only this committed in-flight state may deterministically
induce witness-completion material U (w, v) for a compatible limbo vault v ∈VP (w)(t). Thus the
missing tumbler is the policy-bound in-flight conversion state, not the uncommitted token as such.

Proposition 2 (Formal Withdrawal Law). For a withdrawal intent w, redemption to Bitcoin is
protocol-valid iff
Withdraw(w, t) = C(w) = Committed
DSM-side commitment
∧ ∃v ∈VP (w)(t) Exec(w, v)
compatible BTC collateral
∧ P (v) = P (w)
same CPTA policy
If BitcoinSpend(w) is achieved, the committed amount resolves by final burn.
If BitcoinSpend(w) is not achieved under protocol-defined failure conditions, the committed amount
resolves by refund rather than burn.
Proposition 3 (Withdrawal Resolution Versus Vault Admission). The Bitcoin-side user payout
and any successor vault produced by the same withdrawal play distinct protocol roles.
• The user payout output resolves the committed withdrawal amount once BitcoinSpend(w) is
achieved.
• The successor vault, when present, is a newly created Bitcoin-side collateral object and requires
burial before re-admission into the DSM live collateral set.
Therefore the burial parameter applies to vault admission, including successor-vault admission, and
not as an additional hold on the user-directed withdrawal amount.

Definition 17 (Vault-Layer Bearer Authorization). For every limbo vault v with fulfillment mechanism
BitcoinHTLC under policy class P, exit authorization at the DSM vault layer is determined solely by
satisfaction of the executable withdrawal predicate Exec(w, v) — i.e., possession of policy-class-bound
witness-completion material U(w, v) under the committed in-flight conversion state Θ(w). The DSM-side
vault field intended_recipient (a Kyber public key used by non-dBTC vaults for recipient-bound content
decryption) does not gate exit authorization for BitcoinHTLC fulfillment. Recipient binding for dBTC
withdrawals is enforced exclusively at the Bitcoin layer via the HTLC spend path and the destination
addrBTC(w).

Equivalently: dBTC vaults are bearer-authorized at the DSM-vault layer. Possession of policy-class-bound
witness-completion material is the sole authorization predicate; no Kyber-recipient-pubkey check is
applied at the DSM layer.

Invariant 5 (Bearer Authorization for dBTC Vaults). For every committed withdrawal w and every
compatible vault v with fulfillment(v) = BitcoinHTLC,

    Exec(w, v) ⇒ DSM-vault-layer admits unlock(w, v),

independent of any DSM-side intended_recipient field on v. Recipient identity is enforced solely at the
Bitcoin layer through addrBTC(w) and the HTLC spend predicate.

Remark (Implementation Note). The DSM vault implementation (vault::limbo_vault) carries an
intended_recipient: Option<Vec<u8>> field on every vault. For non-dBTC fulfillment mechanisms this
field gates unlock, activate, and claim against the requester's public key. For BitcoinHTLC fulfillment
this field is, by Invariant 5, ignored at the DSM layer. Setting intended_recipient: Some(_) on a
BitcoinHTLC vault is therefore semantically meaningless for authorization and should be avoided by
callers; the recipient is determined by the addrBTC paid by the HTLC spend transaction.
