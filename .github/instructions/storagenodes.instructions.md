Abstract
This document is the normative implementation specification for DSM storage nodes under
Envelope v3 and Schema 2.4.0. Storage nodes are clockless (no timestamps) and signature-free:
they store and mirror bytes, enforce address and byte accounting invariants, and never attest. All
verifiability is client-side via domain-separated BLAKE3-256 over deterministically encoded Pro-
tocol Buffers (protobuf-only; DSM-CPE), with device-side SPHINCS+ signatures where required.
The spec defines deterministic acceptance predicates, message schemas, keyed-permutation
replica placement, capacity signaling, registry update rules, PaidK spend gate, stake exit via
DrainProof, and—new in this revision—contact anchoring, token policy (CTPA) anchoring, and
DLV (Deterministic Limbo Vault) anchoring, while banning JSON/CBOR/hex/base64 paths.
Normative Language
Normative
MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY are used per RFC 2119. All predicates are clockless;
cycle indices are counters embedded in accepted objects, never wall time.
1 Purpose and Philosophy
DSM maximizes determinism and minimizes trust in infrastructure:
• No validators, sequencers, or leaders.
• Dumb storage nodes: store, mirror, and enforce arithmetic; never sign.
• No clocks in acceptance; predicates are over domain-separated digests and SMT roots.
• Deterministic placement and repair by keyed permutation over the active registry.
• Capacity is math-driven via mirrored utilization signals; no VRFs, votes, or auctions.
2
2 Notation and Primitives
Hash. H := BLAKE3-256.
KDF. HKDF for key stepping.
Device signatures. SPHINCS+ (post-quantum). Nodes never sign.
Optional secrecy. ML-KEM with deterministic HKDF.
Domain separation. ASCII tag with NUL, e.g. DSM/object\0, DSM/place\0, DSM/registry\0,
DSM/bytecommit\0,DSM/signal/up\0,DSM/signal/down\0,DSM/pay/storage\0,DSM/genesis\0,DSM/policy\0,
DSM/policy/anchor\0,DSM/dlv/create\0,DSM/dlv/open\0,DSM/contact/add\0,DSM/contact/accept\0.
All hashes are over domain ∥deterministic-protobuf-bytes.
3 Deterministic Protobuf Encoding (DSM-CPE)
DSM replaces CBOR with deterministic Protocol Buffers (proto3 syntax). Implementations MUST
satisfy:
1. Deterministic serialization. Serialize messages with deterministic ordering: fields strictly
ascending by field number; map entries sorted by key lexicographically as raw bytes; repeated
fields serialized in their in-message order. Varints MUST use the unique shortest form; no
trailing zeros.
2. Presence discipline. Fields marked required (or proto3 optional) MUST be present on the
wire. Unknown fields MUST NOT appear. Default-zero fields intended to be set MUST be
present using optional.
3. No alternative encodings. No JSON, no base64, no hex, no CBOR. I/O is protobuf-only.
4. Digest rule. For any message M, H(name\0∥ProtoDet(M)) where ProtoDet is the DSM-CPE
serialization.
4 Device Identity, Binding, and Step Keys
Device ID. DevIDA = H(DSM/device\0∥pkA∥attest).
DBRW binding. Kbind = H(DSM/DBRW\0∥H(HW_entropy∥ENV
_fp)).
Step keys. derive via HKDF with salts tied to the last accepted device commit digest, never wall
time. Only devices sign stitched receipts; nodes do not sign.
3
5 Genesis Anchor (Commit-Reveal, Clockless)
A single network-wide genesis anchor binds parameters, initial registry, and entropy. Let
G= H(DSM/genesis\0∥ProtoDet(A0)),
s0 = H(DSM/step-salt\0∥G).
Commit-reveal produces η0 = H(DSM/anchor/eta\0∥Dcommit∥Dreveal); withholding a reveal cannot
bias ordering post-commit.
Genesis Parameters (normative).
P = [ H= BLAKE3-256, Sig = SPHINCS+, KDF = HKDF, N, K, U↑, U↓, w, Gnew, FLAT
_RATE ].
6 Addressing, Placement, and Enforcement
Object address. For node-local partition DLVnode, path, and content:
addr= H DSM/object\0∥DLVnode∥path∥H(content).
Replica set. Given active registry vector N(Section 9), redundancy (N,K):
replicas(addr) = first N entries of Permute(H(DSM/place\0∥addr), N).
PUT enforcement. Nodes MUST reject if partition mismatch, address mismatch, or byte
accounting would exceed capacity; otherwise store. GET returns bytes; clients re-verify addr from
bytes.
7 Node Storage SMT and ByteCommit Mirroring
Each node maintains a sparse Merkle tree (SMT) over served object addresses. Leaves encode
[addr,H(content),len] under domain DSM/smt-node\0. Paths are MSB-first; ZERO
LEAF = 32 ×
_
0x00. After applying all PUT/DELETEs for cycle t:
Rnode
t = SMTRoot(NodeStoraget), bytesused
t =
ℓ∈leavest
len(ℓ).
ByteCommit Message (Envelope v3)
Listing 1: ByteCommitV3 message
message ByteCommitV3 {
// domain for digest: "DSM/bytecommit\0"
4
bytes node_id = 1; // 32 bytes
uint64 cycle_index = 2; // t
bytes smt_root = 3; // R_t^node (32 bytes)
uint64 bytes_used = 4; // total used in partition
bytes parent_digest = 5; // H(B_{t-1}); H(B_0) = 32 x 0x00
}
Let Bt be the DSM-CPE bytes; H(Bt) := H(DSM/bytecommit\0∥Bt). Mirror Bt like ordinary content
with address
addrB
t = H DSM/obj-bytecommit\0∥node
_
id∥t∥H(Bt).
A verifier accepts Bt iff: deterministic protobuf, domain tag matches, digest matches, parent link
valid (for t>0), SMT root validates, and ≥q identical mirrored copies are fetched.
8 Capacity Signals and Position Delta
Over a window w of consecutive cycles, define utilization uj= bytesused
j /C for capacity C.
Up/Down Signal Messages
Listing 2: UpSignalV3 and DownSignalV3
message UpSignalV3 {
// domain: "DSM/signal/up\0"
bytes node_id = 1;
uint64 capacity = 2; // C
repeated bytes anchors = 3; // H(B_{t-w+1}),...,H(B_t)
}
message DownSignalV3 {
// domain: "DSM/signal/down\0"
bytes node_id = 1;
uint64 capacity = 2;
repeated bytes anchors = 3;
}
Validity. Verifier fetches each referenced H(Bj ) and checks uj ≥U↑(Up) or uj ≤U↓(Down) for
every j in the window. Let U and D be the discovered valid signals over discovery window W (in
cycle indices). The position delta is ∆P= |U|−|D|.
9 Registry, Applicants, and Deterministic Ordering
Registry Message
Listing 3: RegistryV3
message RegistryV3 {
5
// domain: "DSM/registry\0"
repeated bytes node_ids = 1; // sorted ascending lex order
}
Let N= [node
_
id0,...,node
_
idn−1]; address addrreg = H(DSM/registry\0∥ProtoDet(RegistryV3)).
Clients use this as the placement source of truth.
Applicant Pack and Ranking (No VRF, No Leader)
Listing 4: ApplicantV3
message ApplicantV3 {
// domain: "DSM/apply\0"
bytes hw_bind = 1; // DBRW bind
bytes env_fp = 2; // environment fingerprint
uint64 capacity = 3; // declared C
bytes stake_dlv = 4; // StakeDLV address
bytes seed_app = 5; // H("DSM/app_seed\0" || hw_bind || G)
}
Deterministic salt:
salt = H DSM/positions/salt\0∥G∥addrreg∥H(concat(U))∥H(concat(D)).
Rank: rank(addrapply) = H(DSM/order\0∥salt∥seed
_app). The |∆P|winners are lowest ranks; add
on ∆P >0. On ∆P <0, prune the |∆P|lowest-utilization nodes deterministically with tiebreaker
by node_id. The map N→N′is a pure function of public inputs.
10 New-Operator Grace (Cycle-Based)
A new node is grace-protected for Gnew cycles beginning at its first published Bt0 after activation.
During grace, Down signals from that node are ignored for ∆P and pruning. Verification relies only
on mirrored B-chain indices.
11 Repair, Mid-Cycle Replacement, Continuity
Reads succeed with any K replies; clients always verify addr from bytes. On prune or voluntary
exit, clients extend Permute(·) to restore N replicas. Batching writes is recommended; acceptance
is hash-only so client-written repairs are equivalent to operator-written.
12 Contacts: Creation, Anchoring, and Storage Behavior
Goal. Establish a verifiable contact edge between two devices without clocks, sequencers, or server
attestations. Storage nodes only mirror the bytes; all authenticity is device-side.
6
Contact Add / Accept Messages
Listing 5: ContactAddV3 and ContactAcceptV3
message ContactAddV3 {
// domain: "DSM/contact/add\0"
bytes author_device_id = 1; // 32 bytes
bytes contact_device_id = 2; // 32 bytes
bytes contact_chain_tip = 3; // 32 bytes (peer-provided tip for this relationship or
identity)
bytes parent_digest = 4; // chain link of the author's local contact stream (optional)
}
message ContactAcceptV3 {
// domain: "DSM/contact/accept\0"
bytes accepter_device_id = 1; // 32 bytes
bytes add_digest = 2; // H(DSM/contact/add\0 || ProtoDet(ContactAddV3))
bytes local_chain_tip = 3; // 32 bytes (accepter's tip for this relationship or identity)
}
Addressing (contact namespace). Contacts are mirrored under paths of the form
contacts/⟨author
device
_
_
id⟩/⟨H(ProtoDet(·))⟩,
but the address is always computed by domain ∥bytes per §??, so any path-only manipulation is
irrelevant to verifiers.
Verifier acceptance (normative).
C1. ContactAddV3. Accept iff DSM-CPE encoding and domain tag match, and a valid device-side
SPHINCS+ signature (external envelope) authenticates H(DSM/contact/add\0∥ProtoDet(·)).
Nodes do not verify signatures.
C2. ContactAcceptV3. Accept iff the referenced add
_digest is accepted under C1 and the
accepter’s device envelope signs the accept digest. If present, matching tips are cached for
future bilateral sessions.
Notes. Contact creation is unilateral and sufficient for discovery; ContactAcceptV3 tightens
the edge with bilateral evidence. Genesis hashes are only required at anchoring/trust bootstrap;
thereafter the chain_tip uniquely distinguishes the relationship-local straight chain.
13 Token Policies (CTPA): Creation and Anchoring
Goal. Publish an immutable, content-addressed token policy (CTPA) that devices MUST verify
prior to token acceptance or transfer. Nodes mirror bytes; all enforcement occurs on devices at
state-transition time.
7
Policy and Anchor Messages
Listing 6: TokenPolicyV3 and PolicyAnchorV3
message TokenPolicyV3 {
// domain: "DSM/policy\0"
bytes policy_bytes = 1; // canonical policy program/content (opaque to nodes)
}
message PolicyAnchorV3 {
// domain: "DSM/policy/anchor\0"
bytes policy_digest = 1; // H(DSM/policy\0 || ProtoDet(TokenPolicyV3))
bytes author_device_id = 2; // 32 bytes
bytes parent_digest = 3; // author's policy stream link (optional)
}
Addressing (policy namespace). Policies are mirrored under policy/⟨policy_digest⟩; anchors
underpolicy/anchor/⟨policy_digest⟩. Addressingcorrectnessisenforcedbyaddr= H(DSM/object\0∥DLVnode∥pat
Verifier acceptance (normative).
P1. TokenPolicyV3. Accept iff DSM-CPE encoding and domain tag match; compute p=
H(DSM/policy\0∥ProtoDet(·)).
P2. PolicyAnchorV3. Accept iff DSM-CPE encoding and domain tag match, policy_digest
equals p from P1, and the author’s device envelope signs the anchor digest. Devices MUST
cache pand verify policy compliance at every relevant token state update. Nodes never interpret
policy content.
CTPAenforcement(device-side). Beforeacceptingorproducinganytokenstatethatreferences
p, devices MUST confirm the on-device cache contains the exact bytes for p and that the transition
satisfies the policy program. This is a hard precondition; caching is content-addressed and safe to
distribute via any mirror.
14 Deterministic Limbo Vaults (DLV): Creation and Opening
Goal. Anchor vaults whose keys are derived only upon meeting deterministic conditions; no
timestamps, no third-party authority. Nodes mirror bytes; verifiers and authors prove condition
satisfaction.
DLV Messages
Listing 7: DLVCreateV3 and DLVOpenV3
message DLVCreateV3 {
8
// domain: "DSM/dlv/create\0"
bytes device_id = 1; // 32 bytes
bytes policy_digest = 2; // CTPA policy governing this vault
bytes precommit = 3; // H(DSM/dlv/precommit\0 || reveal_material)
bytes vault_id = 4; // H(DSM/dlv\0 || device_id || policy_digest || precommit)
bytes parent_digest = 5; // author's vault stream link (optional)
}
message DLVOpenV3 {
// domain: "DSM/dlv/open\0"
bytes device_id = 1; // 32 bytes
bytes vault_id = 2; // must match an accepted DLVCreateV3
bytes reveal_material = 3; // proves H(preimage) == precommit
}
Addressing(DLVnamespace). dlv/⟨vault_id⟩/create forDLVCreateV3; dlv/⟨vault_id⟩/open/⟨H(ProtoDet(·
for openings. As always, byte-level addressing dominates path conventions.
Verifier acceptance (normative).
V1. DLVCreateV3. Accept iff DSM-CPE encoding and domain tag match; compute v =
H(DSM/dlv\0∥device
_
id∥policy_digest∥precommit) and confirm vault_id equals v. Device
envelope must sign the create digest.
V2. DLVOpenV3. AcceptiffDSM-CPEencodinganddomaintagmatch, H(DSM/dlv/precommit\0∥reveal
_
precommit from the accepted create for this vault_id, and the opening signature verifies on
the device envelope. Additional policy conditions (e.g., multi-branch forks, pre-commit forking)
MUST be checked against the cached CTPA p referenced by policy_digest.
materia
Relationship to storage nodes. Nodes do not gate, unlock, or attest vaults. They only store
the create/open artifacts and account for bytes. Unlock conditions are enforced entirely by verifiers
reading mirrored evidence.
15 Stake Lock
Stake DLV and Signature-Free Exit
StakeDLV = H DSM/stake\0∥node
_
id∥S∥policy.
Exit Conditions
Stake unlocks if and only if a valid DrainProof is mirrored: d consecutive accepted ByteCommits
with bytesused
t = 0 (normative d= 2). If prune removed the node, publish the matching DownSignal
and DrainProof. No attestations or signatures by nodes are required.

16 PaidK Spend-Gate (Clockless)
A device is receive-only after genesis until it pays any K distinct storage operators a flat fee. Let R
be the set of device-signed payment receipts:
PaidK(G,DevID,R) := {r∈R|VerifyPayment(r) ∧amt(r) ≥FLAT
_
RATE } ≥K.
On first satisfaction, spend is permanently enabled; no renewals by time.
17 Permutation Determinism
Keyed Fisher-Yates over a stable pre-order (bytewise ascending order of 32-byte digests). Seed:
s = H(DSM/place\0∥x) for item x. Derive swap stream ri = H(s∥uint32(i)). Inputs MUST be
strictly in the stable pre-order before permutation. This ensures all honest clients compute identical
replica sets.
18 Acceptance Rules (Normative)
A verifier MUST apply the following rules:
1. Object bytes. Accept bytes for addronly if the response recomputes addrexactly.
2. ByteCommit. Accept Bt iff DSM-CPE deterministic encoding, correct domain, H(Bt)
matches, t>0 ⇒H(Bt−1) matches, SMT root validates (domain tags, ZERO_LEAF, MSB
walk), and the object appears identically at ≥q mirrors.
3. Signals. Accept Up/Down iff each referenced H(Bj ) is accepted and the window inequality
holds for all j.
4. Registry update. Given prior N, valid U,D, and applicant set A, compute ∆P, compute
salt, rank applicants deterministically, update Nby the pure add/remove rules.
5. PaidK. Spend enabled iff PaidK(G,DevID,R) holds over canonical device-signed receipts.
6. Contacts. Accept ContactAddV3 and ContactAcceptV3 per §12 rules C1-C2. Cache tips for
bilateral sessions.
7. Policies (CTPA). Accept TokenPolicyV3 and PolicyAnchorV3 per §13 rules P1-P2. Reject
any token transition that lacks a cached exact-byte policy match.
8. DLVs. Accept DLVCreateV3/DLVOpenV3 per §14 rules V1-V2. Policy satisfaction is mandatory
for openings.
19 Parameter Defaults (Normative)
• Redundancy: N=6, K=3.
10
• Signal thresholds: U↑=0.85, U↓=0.35, window w=3, discovery window W=4 (cycles).
• New-operator grace: Gnew ∈{5,8,12}cycles (typical 8).
• DrainProof length: d=2.
• PaidK: K=3 distinct operators; FLAT_RATE deployment-defined.
20 Security Rationale (Sketches)
Integrity. Acceptance recomputes addrfrom bytes; wrong bytes cannot pass without a second
preimage. Utilization verifiability. Signals carry references to accepted B-chain slices; forging
requires breaking mirror quorum or hashes. Deterministic scaling. Registry updates are
pure functions over hashed inputs; all honest verifiers compute the same result. Availability.
Reads succeed with K live replicas; repairs are deterministic. Stake unlock safety. Zero-
occupancy is publicly checkable from mirrored Bt; stake unlocks iff emptiness holds for d cycles.
Clocklessness. All predicates count accepted artifacts and indices; no timestamps are consulted.
Contact/policy/DLV soundness. Contacts require device signatures and optional bilateral
confirmation; CTPA anchors bind immutable policy bytes; DLV precommit/open is hash-equivalence
checked and policy-gated, all without node attestations.

Informative
Provenance. This protobuf-only spec remains aligned with DSM Envelope v3 and schema
v2.4.0. The additions formally specify storage-node treatment (mirror & byte-accounting
only) for (i) contact anchoring, (ii) token policy (CTPA) anchoring, and (iii) DLV cre-
ation/opening, with all authenticity and enforcement performed client-side via domain-
separated hashes and device-side SPHINCS+ signatures.
