Statelessness Reframed:
Why Partitioned, Relationship-Local State Escapes the a16z Lower
Bound
and How DSM Compares to INTMAX

Abstract
Christ & Bonneau (a16z Crypto) formalize an information-theoretic impossibility for “stateless
blockchains”: when validators keep a succinct commitment to a global state, user witnesses must
refresh frequently—even for inactive users—by a Shannon-style counting bound. We prove a
clean separation. We define the Partitioned, Relationship-Local State Machine (PRLSM) model,
instantiated by DSM, in which there is no succinct global commitment; verification and ordering
occur via bilateral hash chains and device-local authenticated structures (Per-Device SMT and
Device Tree). We show the a16z bound does not apply to PRLSM: witness churn for an inactive
user is zero for transitions disjoint from that user’s relationships, and in general scales with
the user’s touch-degree rather than global throughput. We contrast with rollup designs like
INTMAX which optimize within the a16z model (bytes/tx, DA minimization) yet preserve a
global commitment and thus the witness-refresh tradeoff.
1 Background: Revocable Witnesses & Global Succinctness
Definition 1.1 (Global-Succinct Commitment Model (GSCM)). A system is in GSCM if (i) there
exists a global application state Statet after t transitions; (ii) validators maintain a fixed-size
commitment Roott = H(Statet) independent of |Statet|; (iii) a user proving a fact f about Statet
supplies a witness wit(f, Roott) which validators verify against Roott.
Definition 1.2 (Revocable Witness System (RWS)). An RWS augments GSCM with a witness
refresh rule: when Statet →Statet+1, previously valid wit may be revoked; users must refresh to wit′
consistent with Roott+1. A scheme is refresh-light if the expected number of users who must refresh
per transition is sublinear in the number of accounts.
Theorem 1.1 (Christ-Bonneau impossibility, informal). In any RWS where validators keep a
constant-sized commitment Roott to a global state, there exists a distribution of transactions for
which the expected number of users requiring witness refresh over T steps is Ω(T ), even if many
users are inactive.
Sketch (Shannon counting). Alice encodes a subset S ⊆[n] of accounts by applying transactions
and broadcasting the constant-sized update Roott+1. Bob, with pre-update witnesses, detects which
witnesses revoked and thereby recovers S. Since there are 2n possible S, Alice would need ≥n bits
to communicate S, contradicting the constant-size update unless many users’ witnesses revoke each
step. (See [1] for the full argument.)

2 DSM as a Partitioned, Relationship-Local State Machine
DSM does not maintain a global monolithic state. Each device D maintains: (i) a Device Tree root
RG binding device identities to genesis; (ii) a Per-Device SMT root rD mapping each bilateral key
(D, D) to the tip hD,D of a straight hash chain; (iii) stitched receipts proving inclusion under rD,
rD, and membership in RG, with per-step SPHINCS+ signatures. (See [5, 6] for protocol invariants
and anti-cloning.)
Definition 2.1 (PRLSM). A system is a PRLSM if (i) the application state factors as disjoint
per-relationship chains {Ci,j }; (ii) user i authenticates only {Ci,j }j under a device-local root ri;
(iii) correctness of a transition on Ci,j requires only inclusion proofs into ri, rj and membership
of DevIDi, DevIDj in RG; (iv) ordering is enforced by adjacency (successor commits parent) and
fork-exclusion (Tripwire).
3 Separation from the a16z Lower Bound
Lemma 3.1 (Non-interference of disjoint relationships). Let u be a user and let T be any sequence
of transitions that touch no chain Cu,∗. Then ru and the proofs witu maintained by u remain valid
across T; no refresh is required for u.
Proof. Transitions on Ck,ℓ with k, ℓ ̸= u do not modify leaves keyed by (u, ∗) under ru. Inclusion
paths for (u, ∗) remain stable; RG is unaffected. Hence witu persists across T without refresh.
Lemma 3.2 (Locality of verification). For a transition on Cu,v from tip h to h′, correctness is
decidable from: (i) inclusion of h under ru and rv ; (ii) inclusion of DevIDu, DevIDv under RG;
(iii) a stitched receipt carrying these proofs and per-step signatures. No facts about any Cx,y with
{x, y}∩{u, v}= ∅ are required.
Theorem 3.1 (Separation). In a PRLSM, for any inactive user u and any sequence T of T
transitions disjoint from Cu,∗, the number of required witness refreshes for u is 0. In general, u’s
refresh work is O(#{steps on Cu,∗}), independent of global T.
Proof. Immediate from Lemma 3.1. Since PRLSM has no succinct global Roott, the Shannon
encoding in Theorem 1.1 never arises: there is no constant-size global update that implicitly
communicates arbitrary subsets of unrelated changes to u.
Remark (No contradiction). The a16z impossibility constrains schemes with succinct global state.
PRLSM removes that premise. We do not “beat” the bound; we step outside its domain while
preserving safety via partitioned authenticated structures and the Tripwire invariant [5].
4 Security Invariants (DSM)
Theorem 4.1 (Pending-Online Lock). If an accepted but unsynchronized online projection exists
for (A, B), initiating a new offline transaction for (A, B) is invalid until synchronization clears the
pending item. Transactions on (A, C), C ̸=B, proceed unaffected.
Sketch. Without the lock, two successors could attempt to consume the same parent tip, violating
adjacency. Modal locking preserves single-successor semantics; disjoint relationships commute. (See
protocol notes in [5].)
2
Theorem 4.2 (Atomic Interlock Tripwire). Assuming EUF-CMA for SPHINCS+ and collision
resistance for H, the probability of two distinct accepted successors to the same parent tip is negligible.
Sketch. Two accepted successors imply either a signature forgery or a collision in the chained commit
path (hash adjacency / Merkle path). Both are assumed infeasible [5].
5 INTMAX vs. DSM (Model-Theoretic)
Definition 5.1 (Rollup Commitment Model (RCM)). An RCM system periodically publishes a
commitment Roott to a batch of off-chain transactions/state; users later prove inclusion against
Roott for exits/bridges.
Proposition 5.1 (RCM ⊂GSCM). Any rollup with a single on-chain commitment per batch
instantiates GSCM: validators (L1) keep Roott; users supply witnesses against Roott for with-
drawals/verification.
Corollary 5.1 (Witness refresh persists under rollups). RCM systems inherit Theorem 1.1: unless
users obtain fresh inclusion data (or rely on proof-serving/DA committees), withdrawal/interaction
witnesses go stale as unrelated rollup activity proceeds.
Interpretation. INTMAX optimizes within RCM/GSCM: it minimizes on-chain data (e.g.,∼4-
5 bytes/tx via short nullifiers) and frames itself as a “stateless, client-driven” rollup [2, 3, 4].
That reduces byte growth and DA cost but does not remove the global-commitment premise; the
information-theoretic witness churn still follows the a16z model [1]. DSM (PRLSM) eliminates the
premise entirely.
6 Operational Consequences
Inactive-user burden. In GSCM/RCM, inactive users’ witnesses still change; in PRLSM, they do
not.
Offline UX. GSCM/RCM requires online access to global commitments; PRLSM supports offline
bilateral finality with later deterministic stitching.
Economics. GSCM/RCM couples costs to DA/aggregation; PRLSM aligns costs with stor-
age/availability subscriptions and client-side verification.
7 Conclusion
We formalized a separation: a16z’s impossibility binds schemes with succinct global state and
revocable witnesses. DSM’s PRLSM avoids any global commitment and confines verification to
relationship-local proofs and receipts. Consequently, the witness-refresh lower bound does not apply.
Rollups like INTMAX optimize bytes and privacy within GSCM, but remain bound by the same
information-theoretic tradeoff. Partitioned state is the robust, scalable, future-proof path.
